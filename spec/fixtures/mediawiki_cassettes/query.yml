        through the launch of versions in different languages. All versions of Wikipedia
        are similar, but important differences exist in content and in editing practices.
        The [[English Wikipedia]] is now one of more than 200 Wikipedias, but remains
        the largest one, with {{srlink|Wikipedia:Size of Wikipedia|over {{#expr:0.1*floor
        ({{NUMBEROFARTICLES:R}}/100000)}} million}} articles. As of February 2014,

        tend to show that Wikipedia''s accuracy is similar to Encyclopedia Britannica,
        with Wikipedia being much larger. However, critics have worried that [[Criticism
        of Wikipedia#Systemic bias in coverage|Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias]],
        and that its [[group dynamics]] hinder its goals. Most [[Academia|academics]],
        [[historian]]s, [[teacher]]s and [[journalist]]s reject Wikipedia as a reliable
        source of information for being a mixture of truths, half truths, and some
        falsehoods,<ref name=EdwinBlack/> and that as a resource about controversial
        topics, Wikipedia is notoriously subject to manipulation and spin.<ref name=Petrilli/>
        Wikipedia''s [[WP:consensus|Consensus]] and [[WP:Undue|Undue Weight]] policies
        have been repeatedly criticised by prominent scholarly sources for undermining
        [[freedom of thought]] and leading to false beliefs based on incomplete information.<ref

        between versions of an article are highlighted as shown]]\nUnlike traditional
        encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the procrastination principle--i.e. waiting
        for a problem to arise and then fixing it--regarding the security of its content;<ref>{{cite

        articles, and any Wikipedia article could be edited by any reader, even those
        who did not have a Wikipedia account. Modifications to all articles would
        immediately become available. As a result, all articles could contain inaccuracies,
        ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text until an editor would
        correct these issues.\n\n=== Restrictions ===\nOver time, the English Wikipedia
        and some other Wikipedias gradually restricted modifications. For example,
        in the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered
        users may create a new article.<ref>{{srlink|Wikipedia:Tutorial/Registration|Registration
        notes}}</ref> On the English Wikipedia and some others, some particularly
        sensitive and/or vandalism-prone pages are now \"protected\" to some degree.<ref
        name=\"WP protection policy 1\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Protection policy|Protection
        Policy}}</ref> A frequently vandalized article can be ''''[[Help:Semi-protection|semi-protected]]'''',
        meaning that only certain editors are able to modify it.<ref>[[Help:Semi-protection|English

        able to make changes.<ref>{{srlink|Wikipedia:Full protection|English Wikipedia''s
        full protection policy}}</ref>\n\nIn certain cases, all editors are allowed
        to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors. For example,
        the [[German Wikipedia]] maintains \"stable versions\" of articles,<ref name=\"WP
        some sites stable versions 1\">{{cite mailing list|first=P.|last=Birken|url=http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikide-l/2008-December/021594.html|title=Bericht

        of changes===\nAlthough changes are not systematically reviewed, the software
        that powers Wikipedia provides certain tools allowing anyone to review changes
        made by others. The \"History\" page of each article links to each revision.<ref

        infringements [[WP:Suppression|may be removed completely]].</ref><ref name=\"Torsten_Kleinz\"
        /> On most articles, anyone can undo others'' changes by clicking a link on
        the article''s history page. Anyone can view the [[Help:Recent changes|latest
        changes]] to articles, and anyone may maintain a [[Recent changes|\"watchlist\"]]
        of articles that interest them so they can be notified of any changes. \"New
        pages patrol\" is a process whereby newly created articles are checked for
        obvious problems.<ref>[[Wikipedia:New pages patrol]]</ref>\n\nIn 2003, economics
        PhD student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low [[transaction cost]]s of
        participating in a [[wiki]] create a catalyst for collaborative development,
        and that features such as easy access to past versions of a page favor \"creative
        construction\" over \"creative destruction\".<ref name=\"FMonday collaborative

        Wikipedia}}\n\nAny edit that changes content in a way that deliberately compromises
        the integrity of Wikipedia is considered vandalism. The most common and obvious
        types of vandalism include insertion of obscenities and crude humor. Vandalism
        can also include advertising language and other types of [[Wikipedia:Spam|spam]].<ref

        vandalism by removing information or entirely blanking a given page. Less
        common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but
        false information to an article, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals
        can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page''s
        title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an article, or
        use images disruptively.<ref name=\"WP vandalism manipulation 1\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Vandalism|Vandalism}}.

        rituals, such as signing talk pages, implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia

        their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs:
        the contributor is expected to build a user page, learn Wikipedia-specific
        technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process,
        and learn a \"baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references\".

        not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small
        towns in the United States might only be available in English, even when they

        Wikipedia was cited by ''''The Economist'''' as substantially in contrast
        to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). ''''The
        Economist'''' reported that the number of contributors with an average of
        five of more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia
        in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal
        variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The attrition rates for editors
        in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, were cited as peaking in 2007 at
        approximately 50,000 editors which has dropped to 30,000 editors as of the
        start of 2014. At the quoted trend rate, the number of active editors in English
        Wikipedia has lost approximately 20,000 editors to attrition since 2007, and
        the documented trend rate indicates the loss of another 20,000 editors by
        2021, down to 10,000 active editors on English Wikipedia by 2021 if left unabated.<ref
        name=\"economist1\" /> Given that the trend analysis published in ''''The
        Economist'''' presents the number of active editors for Wikipedia in other
        languages (non-English Wikipedia) as remaining relatively constant and successful
        in sustaining its numbers at approximately 42,000 active editors, the contrast
        has pointed to the effectiveness of Wikipedia in other languages to retain
        its active editors on a renewable and sustained basis.<ref name=\"economist1\"
        /> No comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy
        standards from Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) would

        by the npov policy\u2014[which] means that it is hard to discern any overall
        interpretive stance in Wikipedia history\". By example, he quoted the conclusion
        of Wikipedia''s article on [[William Clarke Quantrill]]. While generally praising
        the article, he pointed out its \"waffling\" conclusion: \"Some historians

        are factually accurate, they are often written in a poor, almost unreadable
        style. Frequent Wikipedia critic Andrew Orlowski commented: \"Even when a

        His research examined the [[counterproductive work behavior]] of edit warring.
        Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \"undo\" operations were not the
        most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and relied
        instead on the statistical measurement of detecting \"reverting/reverted pairs\"
        or \"mutually reverting edit pairs.\" Such a \"mutually reverting edit pair\"
        is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in
        sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the \"mutually reverting edit
        pairs.\" The results were tabulated for all language versions of Wikipedia,
        with the English Wikipedia three largest conflict rates applying to articles
        about (i) ''''G.W. Bush'''', (ii) ''''Anarchism'''' and (iii) ''''Mohammad''''.<ref
        name=\"autogenerated3\" /> By comparison, for German Wikipedia the three largest
        conflict rates at the time of the Oxford study were for the articles covering
        (i) ''''Croatia'''', (ii) ''''Scientology'''' and (iii) ''''9/11 Conspiracy

        I), which initially required [[CamelCase]] for article hyperlinks; the present
        double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase
        II), Wikipedia began running on a [[PhpWiki|PHP wiki]] engine with a MySQL
        database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by [[Magnus Manske]].
        The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the [[Exponential

        of quality classes begins with \"Stub\" (very short pages), followed by \"Start\",
        \"C\" and \"B\" (in increasing order of quality). Community peer review is

        five forces analysis]] framework for industry analysis, Wikipedia and its
        parent institution Wikimedia are known as \"first movers\" and \"radical innovators\"
        in the services provided and supported by an open-source, on-line encyclopedia.<ref
        name=\"Porter, M.E. 1985\">Porter, M.E. (1985) Competitive Advantage, Free
        Press, New York, 1985.</ref> The \"five forces\" are centered around the issue
        of \"competitive rivalry\" within the encyclopedia industry where Wikipedia
        is seen as having redefined by its \"radical innovation\" the parameters of
        effectiveness applied to conventional encyclopedia publication. This is the
        first force of Porter''s five forces analysis.<ref name=\"Porter, M.E. 1980\">Porter,
        M.E. (1980) Competitive Strategy, Free Press, New York, 1980.</ref> The second
        force is the \"threat of new entrants\" with competitive services and products
        possibly arising on the internet or the web. As a \"first mover\", Wikipedia
        has largely eluded the emergence of a [[fast second]] to challenge its radical
        innovation and its standing as the central provider of the services which
        it offers through the World Wide Web.<ref>Markides, Constantinos (2005). Fast
        Second, Wiley&Sons Inc., San Francisco, 2005</ref> Porter''s third force is
        the \"threat of substitute products\" and it is too early to identify Google''s
        \"Knowledge Graphs\" as an effective competitor given the current dependence
        of \"Knowledge Graphs\" upon Wikipedia''s free access to its open-source services.<ref
        name=\"Porter, M.E. 1985\" /> The fourth force in the [[Porter five forces
        analysis]] is the \"bargaining power of consumers\" who use the services provided
        by Wikipedia, which has historically largely been nullified by the Wikipedia
        founding principle of an open invitation to expand and edit its content expressed
        in its moniker of being \"the encyclopedia which anyone can edit.\"<ref name=\"Porter,
        M.E. 1980\" /> The fifth force in the [[Porter five forces analysis]] is defined
        as the \"bargaining power of suppliers\", presently seen as the open domain
        of both the global internet as a whole and the resources of public libraries
        world-wide, and therefore it is not seen as a limiting factor in the immediate
        future of the further development of Wikipedia.<ref name=\"Porter, M.E. 1985\"

        the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by [[GNU
        Free Documentation License]] (GFDL), a [[copyleft]] license permitting the
        redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content
        while authors retain copyright of their work.<ref name=\"WP copyright and
        commerciality 1\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Copyrights}}</ref> GFDL was created for
        software manuals that come with [[free software]] programs licensed under
        [[GPL]]. This made it a poor choice for a general reference work; for example,
        the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a
        full copy of the GFDL license text. In December 2002, the [[Creative Commons
        license]] was released: it was specifically designed for creative works in
        general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity among
        bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia
        project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.<ref name=\"WPF switch to

        incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the
        [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) released a new version of GFDL designed
        specifically to allow Wikipedia to {{srlink|Wikipedia:Licensing update|relicense

        held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.<ref

        The website [[DBpedia]], begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and
        category declarations of the English-language Wikipedia. Wikimedia has created
        the [[Wikidata]] project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts
        from each page of Wikipedia and the other WMF wikis and make it available
        in a queriable [[Semantic Web|semantic]] format, [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]].
        This is still under development. As of Feb 2014 it has 15,000,000 items and
        1,000 properties for describing them.\n\nObtaining the full contents of Wikipedia
        for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via a [[web crawler]]
        is discouraged.<ref name=\"WP DB usage policy 1\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Database

        general public. According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in the [[Journal of

        of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic
        from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and
        worry.<ref name=\"small screen\" /> The ''''The New York Times'''' article
        reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, \"Only 20
        percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile
        devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic
        for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to
        mobile editing has lagged even more.\"<ref name=\"small screen\" /> ''''The

        200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited
        by ''''The New York Times'''' for the \"worry\" is for Wikipedia to effectively

        to Wikipedia. Directly after the posted web interview, the representatives
        stated that Wikimedia would be applying an all-inclusive approach to accommodate
        as many mobile access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general
        mobile access, including BlackBerry and the Windows Phone system, making market
        share a secondary issue.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> The latest version of

        serves as a target knowledge base for the [[entity linking]] problem, which

        projects ==\nA number of interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating
        entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The
        first of these was the 1986 [[BBC Domesday Project]], which included text
        (entered on [[BBC Micro]] computers) and photographs from over 1&nbsp;million
        contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the
        UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the
        first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the
        majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK.
        The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated
        on a website until 2008.<ref name=\"Domesday Project\" />\n\nOne of the most
        successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public
        was [[h2g2]], which was created by [[Douglas Adams]]. The h2g2 encyclopedia
        is relatively light-hearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and
        informative. [[Everything2]] was created in 1998. All of these projects had
        similarities with Wikipedia, but were not wikis and neither gave full editorial
        privileges to public users.\n\n[[GNE (encyclopedia)|GNE]], an encyclopedia
        which was not a wiki, also created in January 2001, co-existed with Nupedia
        and Wikipedia early in its history; however, it has been retired.<ref name=\"stallman1999\"
        />\n\nOther websites centered on collaborative [[knowledge base]] development
        have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as [[Susning.nu]], [[Enciclopedia
        Libre Universal en Espa\u00f1ol|Enciclopedia Libre]], [[Hudong]], and [[Baidu
        Baike]] likewise employ no formal review process, although some like [[Conservapedia]]
        are not as open. Others use more traditional [[peer review]], such as [[Encyclopedia
        of Life]] and the online wiki encyclopedias [[Scholarpedia]] and [[Citizendium]].
        The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative
        to Wikipedia.<ref name=\"Orlowski18\" /><ref name=\"JayLyman\" />\n\n== See

        long, in large part about the future (development), not presented with structure
        (long question period), somewhat outdated, and only an elite audience will
        understand all topics (certainly not a first-time reader of this article).
        Some topics: Visual editor (outdated), code review, wiki engines, MediaWiki''s
        database model, MediaWiki''s suitability for Wikimedia sites, AFD process,
        flagged revisions and proposed more advanced revision selection mechanisms,

        are similar, but important differences exist in content and in editing practices.
        The [[English Wikipedia]] is now one of more than 200 Wikipedias, but remains
        the largest one, with {{srlink|Wikipedia:Size of Wikipedia|over {{#expr:0.1*floor
        ({{NUMBEROFARTICLES:R}}/100000)}} million}} articles. As of February 2014,

        tend to show that Wikipedia''s accuracy is similar to Encyclopedia Britannica,
        with Wikipedia being much larger. However, critics have worried that [[Criticism
        of Wikipedia#Systemic bias in coverage|Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias]],
        and that its [[group dynamics]] hinder its goals. Most [[Academia|academics]],
        [[historian]]s, [[teacher]]s and [[journalist]]s reject Wikipedia as a reliable
        source of information for being a mixture of truths, half truths, and some
        falsehoods,<ref name=EdwinBlack/> and that as a resource about controversial
        topics, Wikipedia is notoriously subject to manipulation and spin.<ref name=Petrilli/>
        Wikipedia''s [[WP:consensus|Consensus]] and [[WP:Undue|Undue Weight]] policies
        have been repeatedly criticised by prominent scholarly sources for undermining
        [[freedom of thought]] and leading to false beliefs based on incomplete information.<ref

        between versions of an article are highlighted as shown]]\nUnlike traditional
        encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the procrastination principle--i.e. waiting
        for a problem to arise and then fixing it--regarding the security of its content;<ref>{{cite

        articles, and any Wikipedia article could be edited by any reader, even those
        who did not have a Wikipedia account. Modifications to all articles would
        immediately become available. As a result, all articles could contain inaccuracies,
        ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text until an editor would
        correct these issues.\n\n=== Restrictions ===\nOver time, the English Wikipedia
        and some other Wikipedias gradually restricted modifications. For example,
        in the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered
        users may create a new article.<ref>{{srlink|Wikipedia:Tutorial/Registration|Registration
        notes}}</ref> On the English Wikipedia and some others, some particularly
        sensitive and/or vandalism-prone pages are now \"protected\" to some degree.<ref
        name=\"WP protection policy 1\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Protection policy|Protection
        Policy}}</ref> A frequently vandalized article can be ''''[[Help:Semi-protection|semi-protected]]'''',

        able to make changes.<ref>{{srlink|Wikipedia:Full protection|English Wikipedia''s
        full protection policy}}</ref>\n\nIn certain cases, all editors are allowed
        to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors. For example,
        the [[German Wikipedia]] maintains \"stable versions\" of articles,<ref name=\"WP
        some sites stable versions 1\">{{cite mailing list|first=P.|last=Birken|url=http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikide-l/2008-December/021594.html|title=Bericht

        of changes===\nAlthough changes are not systematically reviewed, the software
        that powers Wikipedia provides certain tools allowing anyone to review changes
        made by others. The \"History\" page of each article links to each revision.<ref

        infringements [[WP:Suppression|may be removed completely]].</ref><ref name=\"Torsten_Kleinz\"
        /> On most articles, anyone can undo others'' changes by clicking a link on
        the article''s history page. Anyone can view the [[Help:Recent changes|latest
        changes]] to articles, and anyone may maintain a [[Recent changes|\"watchlist\"]]
        of articles that interest them so they can be notified of any changes. \"New

        obvious problems.<ref>[[Wikipedia:New pages patrol]]</ref>\n\nIn 2003, economics
        PhD student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low [[transaction cost]]s of
        participating in a [[wiki]] create a catalyst for collaborative development,
        and that features such as easy access to past versions of a page favor \"creative
        construction\" over \"creative destruction\".<ref name=\"FMonday collaborative

        Wikipedia}}\n\nAny edit that changes content in a way that deliberately compromises
        the integrity of Wikipedia is considered vandalism. The most common and obvious
        types of vandalism include insertion of obscenities and crude humor. Vandalism
        can also include advertising language and other types of [[Wikipedia:Spam|spam]].<ref

        vandalism by removing information or entirely blanking a given page. Less
        common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but
        false information to an article, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals
        can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page''s
        title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an article, or
        use images disruptively.<ref name=\"WP vandalism manipulation 1\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Vandalism|Vandalism}}.

        not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their
        powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and

        their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs:
        the contributor is expected to build a user page, learn Wikipedia-specific
        technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process,
        and learn a \"baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references\".

        the rest, it is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language
        not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small
        towns in the United States might only be available in English, even when they
        meet notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.\n\n[[File:User

        Wikipedia was cited by ''''The Economist'''' as substantially in contrast
        to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). ''''The
        Economist'''' reported that the number of contributors with an average of
        five of more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia
        in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal
        variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The attrition rates for editors
        in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, were cited as peaking in 2007 at
        approximately 50,000 editors which has dropped to 30,000 editors as of the
        start of 2014. At the quoted trend rate, the number of active editors in English
        Wikipedia has lost approximately 20,000 editors to attrition since 2007, and
        the documented trend rate indicates the loss of another 20,000 editors by
        2021, down to 10,000 active editors on English Wikipedia by 2021 if left unabated.<ref
        name=\"economist1\" /> Given that the trend analysis published in ''''The
        Economist'''' presents the number of active editors for Wikipedia in other
        languages (non-English Wikipedia) as remaining relatively constant and successful
        in sustaining its numbers at approximately 42,000 active editors, the contrast
        has pointed to the effectiveness of Wikipedia in other languages to retain
        its active editors on a renewable and sustained basis.<ref name=\"economist1\"
        /> No comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy
        standards from Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) would

        by the npov policy\u2014[which] means that it is hard to discern any overall
        interpretive stance in Wikipedia history\". By example, he quoted the conclusion
        of Wikipedia''s article on [[William Clarke Quantrill]]. While generally praising
        the article, he pointed out its \"waffling\" conclusion: \"Some historians

        are factually accurate, they are often written in a poor, almost unreadable

        His research examined the [[counterproductive work behavior]] of edit warring.
        Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \"undo\" operations were not the
        most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and relied
        instead on the statistical measurement of detecting \"reverting/reverted pairs\"
        or \"mutually reverting edit pairs.\" Such a \"mutually reverting edit pair\"
        is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in
        sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the \"mutually reverting edit
        pairs.\" The results were tabulated for all language versions of Wikipedia,
        with the English Wikipedia three largest conflict rates applying to articles
        about (i) ''''G.W. Bush'''', (ii) ''''Anarchism'''' and (iii) ''''Mohammad''''.<ref
        name=\"autogenerated3\" /> By comparison, for German Wikipedia the three largest
        conflict rates at the time of the Oxford study were for the articles covering
        (i) ''''Croatia'''', (ii) ''''Scientology'''' and (iii) ''''9/11 Conspiracy
        Theories''''.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\" />\n\n=== Explicit content ===\n{{main

        MediaWiki is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] and it is used
        by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. Originally,
        Wikipedia ran on [[UseModWiki]] written in [[Perl]] by Clifford Adams (Phase
        I), which initially required [[CamelCase]] for article hyperlinks; the present
        double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase
        II), Wikipedia began running on a [[PhpWiki|PHP wiki]] engine with a MySQL
        database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by [[Magnus Manske]].
        The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the [[Exponential
        growth|exponentially increasing]] demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia
        shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by

        of quality classes begins with \"Stub\" (very short pages), followed by \"Start\",
        \"C\" and \"B\" (in increasing order of quality). Community peer review is

        five forces analysis]] framework for industry analysis, Wikipedia and its
        parent institution Wikimedia are known as \"first movers\" and \"radical innovators\"
        in the services provided and supported by an open-source, on-line encyclopedia.<ref
        name=\"Porter, M.E. 1985\">Porter, M.E. (1985) Competitive Advantage, Free
        Press, New York, 1985.</ref> The \"five forces\" are centered around the issue
        of \"competitive rivalry\" within the encyclopedia industry where Wikipedia
        is seen as having redefined by its \"radical innovation\" the parameters of
        effectiveness applied to conventional encyclopedia publication. This is the
        first force of Porter''s five forces analysis.<ref name=\"Porter, M.E. 1980\">Porter,
        M.E. (1980) Competitive Strategy, Free Press, New York, 1980.</ref> The second
        force is the \"threat of new entrants\" with competitive services and products
        possibly arising on the internet or the web. As a \"first mover\", Wikipedia
        has largely eluded the emergence of a [[fast second]] to challenge its radical
        innovation and its standing as the central provider of the services which
        it offers through the World Wide Web.<ref>Markides, Constantinos (2005). Fast
        Second, Wiley&Sons Inc., San Francisco, 2005</ref> Porter''s third force is
        the \"threat of substitute products\" and it is too early to identify Google''s
        \"Knowledge Graphs\" as an effective competitor given the current dependence
        of \"Knowledge Graphs\" upon Wikipedia''s free access to its open-source services.<ref
        name=\"Porter, M.E. 1985\" /> The fourth force in the [[Porter five forces
        analysis]] is the \"bargaining power of consumers\" who use the services provided
        by Wikipedia, which has historically largely been nullified by the Wikipedia
        founding principle of an open invitation to expand and edit its content expressed
        in its moniker of being \"the encyclopedia which anyone can edit.\"<ref name=\"Porter,
        M.E. 1980\" /> The fifth force in the [[Porter five forces analysis]] is defined
        as the \"bargaining power of suppliers\", presently seen as the open domain
        of both the global internet as a whole and the resources of public libraries
        world-wide, and therefore it is not seen as a limiting factor in the immediate
        future of the further development of Wikipedia.<ref name=\"Porter, M.E. 1985\"

        the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by [[GNU
        Free Documentation License]] (GFDL), a [[copyleft]] license permitting the
        redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content
        while authors retain copyright of their work.<ref name=\"WP copyright and
        commerciality 1\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Copyrights}}</ref> GFDL was created for
        software manuals that come with [[free software]] programs licensed under
        [[GPL]]. This made it a poor choice for a general reference work; for example,
        the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a
        full copy of the GFDL license text. In December 2002, the [[Creative Commons
        license]] was released: it was specifically designed for creative works in
        general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity among
        bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia
        project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.<ref name=\"WPF switch to

        incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the
        [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) released a new version of GFDL designed
        specifically to allow Wikipedia to {{srlink|Wikipedia:Licensing update|relicense

        covers Wikipedia contents.) In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects
        held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.<ref

        across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia,
        include non-free image files under [[fair use]] doctrine, while the others
        have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their
        home countries (e.g. in [[Copyright law of Japan|Japanese copyright law]]).
        Media files covered by [[free content]] licenses (e.g. Creative Commons''
        CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions via [[Wikimedia Commons]] repository,
        a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia''s accommodation

        The website [[DBpedia]], begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and
        category declarations of the English-language Wikipedia. Wikimedia has created
        the [[Wikidata]] project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts
        from each page of Wikipedia and the other WMF wikis and make it available
        in a queriable [[Semantic Web|semantic]] format, [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]].
        This is still under development. As of Feb 2014 it has 15,000,000 items and
        1,000 properties for describing them.\n\nObtaining the full contents of Wikipedia
        for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via a [[web crawler]]
        is discouraged.<ref name=\"WP DB usage policy 1\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Database

        of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic
        from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and
        worry.<ref name=\"small screen\" /> The ''''The New York Times'''' article
        reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, \"Only 20
        percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile
        devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic
        for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to
        mobile editing has lagged even more.\"<ref name=\"small screen\" /> ''''The

        200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited
        by ''''The New York Times'''' for the \"worry\" is for Wikipedia to effectively

        to Wikipedia. Directly after the posted web interview, the representatives
        stated that Wikimedia would be applying an all-inclusive approach to accommodate
        as many mobile access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general
        mobile access, including BlackBerry and the Windows Phone system, making market

        Scientific use ===\nIn [[computational linguistics]], [[information retrieval]]
        and [[natural language processing]], Wikipedia has seen widespread use as
        a [[text corpus|corpus]] for linguistic research. In particular, it commonly
        serves as a target knowledge base for the [[entity linking]] problem, which
        is then called \"wikification\",<ref name=\"wikify\">Rada Mihalcea and Andras

        projects ==\nA number of interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating
        entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The
        first of these was the 1986 [[BBC Domesday Project]], which included text
        (entered on [[BBC Micro]] computers) and photographs from over 1&nbsp;million
        contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the
        UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the
        first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the
        majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK.
        The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated
        on a website until 2008.<ref name=\"Domesday Project\" />\n\nOne of the most
        successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public
        was [[h2g2]], which was created by [[Douglas Adams]]. The h2g2 encyclopedia
        is relatively light-hearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and
        informative. [[Everything2]] was created in 1998. All of these projects had
        similarities with Wikipedia, but were not wikis and neither gave full editorial
        privileges to public users.\n\n[[GNE (encyclopedia)|GNE]], an encyclopedia
        which was not a wiki, also created in January 2001, co-existed with Nupedia
        and Wikipedia early in its history; however, it has been retired.<ref name=\"stallman1999\"
        />\n\nOther websites centered on collaborative [[knowledge base]] development
        have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as [[Susning.nu]], [[Enciclopedia
        Libre Universal en Espa\u00f1ol|Enciclopedia Libre]], [[Hudong]], and [[Baidu
        Baike]] likewise employ no formal review process, although some like [[Conservapedia]]
        are not as open. Others use more traditional [[peer review]], such as [[Encyclopedia
        of Life]] and the online wiki encyclopedias [[Scholarpedia]] and [[Citizendium]].
        The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative
        to Wikipedia.<ref name=\"Orlowski18\" /><ref name=\"JayLyman\" />\n\n== See

        long, in large part about the future (development), not presented with structure
        (long question period), somewhat outdated, and only an elite audience will
        understand all topics (certainly not a first-time reader of this article).
        Some topics: Visual editor (outdated), code review, wiki engines, MediaWiki''s
        database model, MediaWiki''s suitability for Wikimedia sites, AFD process,
        flagged revisions and proposed more advanced revision selection mechanisms,

        through the launch of versions in different languages. All versions of Wikipedia
        are similar, but important differences exist in content and in editing practices.
        The [[English Wikipedia]] is now one of more than 200 Wikipedias, but remains
        the largest one, with {{srlink|Wikipedia:Size of Wikipedia|over {{#expr:0.1*floor
        ({{NUMBEROFARTICLES:R}}/100000)}} million}} articles. As of February 2014,

        tend to show that Wikipedia''s accuracy is similar to Encyclopedia Britannica,
        with Wikipedia being much larger. However, critics have worried that [[Criticism
        of Wikipedia#Systemic bias in coverage|Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias]],
        and that its [[group dynamics]] hinder its goals. Most [[Academia|academics]],
        [[historian]]s, [[teacher]]s and [[journalist]]s reject Wikipedia as a reliable
        source of information for being a mixture of truths, half truths, and some
        falsehoods,<ref name=EdwinBlack/> and that as a resource about controversial
        topics, Wikipedia is notoriously subject to manipulation and spin.<ref name=Petrilli/>
        Wikipedia''s [[WP:consensus|Consensus]] and [[WP:Undue|Undue Weight]] policies
        have been repeatedly criticised by prominent scholarly sources for undermining
        [[freedom of thought]] and leading to false beliefs based on incomplete information.<ref

        between versions of an article are highlighted as shown]]\nUnlike traditional
        encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the procrastination principle\u2014i.e. waiting
        for a problem to arise and then fixing it\u2014regarding the security of its
        content;<ref>{{cite book|last=Zittrain|first=Jonathan|title=The Future of

        articles, and any Wikipedia article could be edited by any reader, even those
        who did not have a Wikipedia account. Modifications to all articles would
        immediately become available. As a result, all articles could contain inaccuracies,
        ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text until an editor would
        correct these issues.\n\n=== Restrictions ===\nOver time, the English Wikipedia
        and some other Wikipedias gradually restricted modifications. For example,
        in the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered
        users may create a new article.<ref>{{srlink|Wikipedia:Tutorial/Registration|Registration
        notes}}</ref> On the English Wikipedia and some others, some particularly
        sensitive and/or vandalism-prone pages are now \"protected\" to some degree.<ref
        name=\"WP protection policy 1\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Protection policy|Protection
        Policy}}</ref> A frequently vandalized article can be ''''[[Help:Semi-protection|semi-protected]]'''',

        able to make changes.<ref>{{srlink|Wikipedia:Full protection|English Wikipedia''s
        full protection policy}}</ref>\n\nIn certain cases, all editors are allowed
        to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors. For example,
        the [[German Wikipedia]] maintains \"stable versions\" of articles,<ref name=\"WP
        some sites stable versions 1\">{{cite mailing list|first=P.|last=Birken|url=http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikide-l/2008-December/021594.html|title=Bericht

        of changes===\nAlthough changes are not systematically reviewed, the software
        that powers Wikipedia provides certain tools allowing anyone to review changes
        made by others. The \"History\" page of each article links to each revision.<ref

        infringements [[WP:Suppression|may be removed completely]].</ref><ref name=\"Torsten_Kleinz\"
        /> On most articles, anyone can undo others'' changes by clicking a link on
        the article''s history page. Anyone can view the [[Help:Recent changes|latest
        changes]] to articles, and anyone may maintain a [[Recent changes|\"watchlist\"]]
        of articles that interest them so they can be notified of any changes. \"New
        pages patrol\" is a process whereby newly created articles are checked for
        obvious problems.<ref>[[Wikipedia:New pages patrol]]</ref>\n\nIn 2003, economics
        PhD student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low [[transaction cost]]s of
        participating in a [[wiki]] create a catalyst for collaborative development,
        and that features such as easy access to past versions of a page favor \"creative
        construction\" over \"creative destruction\".<ref name=\"FMonday collaborative

        Wikipedia}}\n\nAny edit that changes content in a way that deliberately compromises
        the integrity of Wikipedia is considered vandalism. The most common and obvious
        types of vandalism include insertion of obscenities and crude humor. Vandalism
        can also include advertising language and other types of [[Wikipedia:Spam|spam]].<ref

        vandalism by removing information or entirely blanking a given page. Less
        common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but
        false information to an article, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals
        can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page''s
        title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an article, or
        use images disruptively.<ref name=\"WP vandalism manipulation 1\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Vandalism|Vandalism}}.

        and therefore worldwide, contributors to the same language edition may use
        different dialects or may come from different countries (as is the case for
        the [[English Wikipedia|English edition]]). These differences may lead to
        some conflicts over [[American and British English spelling differences|spelling

        Wales has described Wikipedia as \"an effort to create and distribute a free

        Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts
        are made to supervise them all. They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki,
        the Wikimedia Foundation''s wiki devoted to maintaining all of its projects
        (Wikipedia and others).<ref name=\"WP metawiki maintenance 1\">{{cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org|title=Meta-Wiki|publisher=Wikimedia

        geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics. As for
        the rest, it is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language
        not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small
        towns in the United States might only be available in English, even when they
        meet notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.\n\n[[File:User

        article titled \"The Future of Wikipedia\" cited a trend analysis concerning

        |accessdate=2014-03-11}}</ref> The attrition rate for active editors in English
        Wikipedia was cited by ''''The Economist'''' as substantially in contrast
        to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). ''''The
        Economist'''' reported that the number of contributors with an average of
        five of more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia
        in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal
        variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The attrition rates for editors
        in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, were cited as peaking in 2007 at
        approximately 50,000 editors which has dropped to 30,000 editors as of the
        start of 2014. At the quoted trend rate, the number of active editors in English
        Wikipedia has lost approximately 20,000 editors to attrition since 2007, and
        the documented trend rate indicates the loss of another 20,000 editors by
        2021, down to 10,000 active editors on English Wikipedia by 2021 if left unabated.<ref
        name=\"economist1\" /> Given that the trend analysis published in ''''The
        Economist'''' presents the number of active editors for Wikipedia in other
        languages (non-English Wikipedia) as remaining relatively constant and successful
        in sustaining its numbers at approximately 42,000 active editors, the contrast
        has pointed to the effectiveness of Wikipedia in other languages to retain
        its active editors on a renewable and sustained basis.<ref name=\"economist1\"
        /> No comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy
        standards from Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) would
        provide a possible alternative to English Wikipedia for effectively ameliorating
        substantial editor attrition rates on the English language Wikipedia.<ref>Andrew

        by the npov policy\u2014[which] means that it is hard to discern any overall
        interpretive stance in Wikipedia history\". By example, he quoted the conclusion

        the article, he pointed out its \"waffling\" conclusion: \"Some historians

        His research examined the [[counterproductive work behavior]] of edit warring.
        Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \"undo\" operations were not the
        most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and relied
        instead on the statistical measurement of detecting \"reverting/reverted pairs\"
        or \"mutually reverting edit pairs.\" Such a \"mutually reverting edit pair\"
        is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in
        sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the \"mutually reverting edit
        pairs.\" The results were tabulated for all language versions of Wikipedia,
        with the English Wikipedia three largest conflict rates applying to articles
        about (i) ''''G.W. Bush'''', (ii) ''''Anarchism'''' and (iii) ''''Mohammad''''.<ref
        name=\"autogenerated3\" /> By comparison, for German Wikipedia the three largest
        conflict rates at the time of the Oxford study were for the articles covering
        (i) ''''Croatia'''', (ii) ''''Scientology'''' and (iii) ''''9/11 Conspiracy
        Theories''''.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\" />\n\n=== Explicit content ===\n{{main

        MediaWiki is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] and it is used
        by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. Originally,
        Wikipedia ran on [[UseModWiki]] written in [[Perl]] by Clifford Adams (Phase
        I), which initially required [[CamelCase]] for article hyperlinks; the present
        double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase
        II), Wikipedia began running on a [[PhpWiki|PHP wiki]] engine with a MySQL
        database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by [[Magnus Manske]].
        The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the [[Exponential
        growth|exponentially increasing]] demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia
        shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by

        five forces analysis]] framework for industry analysis, Wikipedia and its
        parent institution Wikimedia are known as \"first movers\" and \"radical innovators\"
        in the services provided and supported by an open-source, on-line encyclopedia.<ref
        name=\"Porter, M.E. 1985\">Porter, M.E. (1985) Competitive Advantage, Free
        Press, New York, 1985.</ref> The \"five forces\" are centered around the issue
        of \"competitive rivalry\" within the encyclopedia industry where Wikipedia
        is seen as having redefined by its \"radical innovation\" the parameters of
        effectiveness applied to conventional encyclopedia publication. This is the
        first force of Porter''s five forces analysis.<ref name=\"Porter, M.E. 1980\">Porter,
        M.E. (1980) Competitive Strategy, Free Press, New York, 1980.</ref> The second
        force is the \"threat of new entrants\" with competitive services and products
        possibly arising on the internet or the web. As a \"first mover\", Wikipedia
        has largely eluded the emergence of a [[fast second]] to challenge its radical
        innovation and its standing as the central provider of the services which
        it offers through the World Wide Web.<ref>Markides, Constantinos (2005). Fast
        Second, Wiley&Sons Inc., San Francisco, 2005</ref> Porter''s third force is
        the \"threat of substitute products\" and it is too early to identify Google''s
        \"Knowledge Graphs\" as an effective competitor given the current dependence
        of \"Knowledge Graphs\" upon Wikipedia''s free access to its open-source services.<ref
        name=\"Porter, M.E. 1985\" /> The fourth force in the [[Porter five forces
        analysis]] is the \"bargaining power of consumers\" who use the services provided
        by Wikipedia, which has historically largely been nullified by the Wikipedia
        founding principle of an open invitation to expand and edit its content expressed
        in its moniker of being \"the encyclopedia which anyone can edit.\"<ref name=\"Porter,
        M.E. 1980\" /> The fifth force in the [[Porter five forces analysis]] is defined
        as the \"bargaining power of suppliers\", presently seen as the open domain
        of both the global internet as a whole and the resources of public libraries
        world-wide, and therefore it is not seen as a limiting factor in the immediate
        future of the further development of Wikipedia.<ref name=\"Porter, M.E. 1985\"

        the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by [[GNU
        Free Documentation License]] (GFDL), a [[copyleft]] license permitting the
        redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content
        while authors retain copyright of their work.<ref name=\"WP copyright and
        commerciality 1\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Copyrights}}</ref> GFDL was created for
        software manuals that come with [[free software]] programs licensed under
        [[GPL]]. This made it a poor choice for a general reference work; for example,
        the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a
        full copy of the GFDL license text. In December 2002, the [[Creative Commons
        license]] was released: it was specifically designed for creative works in
        general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity among
        bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia
        project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.<ref name=\"WPF switch to

        incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the
        [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) released a new version of GFDL designed
        specifically to allow Wikipedia to {{srlink|Wikipedia:Licensing update|relicense

        held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.<ref

        across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia,
        include non-free image files under [[fair use]] doctrine, while the others
        have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their
        home countries (e.g. in [[Copyright law of Japan|Japanese copyright law]]).
        Media files covered by [[free content]] licenses (e.g. Creative Commons''
        CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions via [[Wikimedia Commons]] repository,
        a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia''s accommodation

        The website [[DBpedia]], begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and
        category declarations of the English-language Wikipedia. Wikimedia has created
        the [[Wikidata]] project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts
        from each page of Wikipedia and the other WMF wikis and make it available
        in a queriable [[Semantic Web|semantic]] format, [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]].
        This is still under development. As of Feb 2014 it has 15,000,000 items and
        1,000 properties for describing them.\n\nObtaining the full contents of Wikipedia
        for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via a [[web crawler]]
        is discouraged.<ref name=\"WP DB usage policy 1\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Database

        general public. According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in the [[Journal of

        of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic
        from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and
        worry.<ref name=\"small screen\" /> The ''''The New York Times'''' article
        reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, \"Only 20
        percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile
        devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic
        for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to
        mobile editing has lagged even more.\"<ref name=\"small screen\" /> ''''The

        of 10 software developers focused on mobile,\" out of a total of approximately
        200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited
        by ''''The New York Times'''' for the \"worry\" is for Wikipedia to effectively

        attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment.<ref

        to Wikipedia. Directly after the posted web interview, the representatives
        stated that Wikimedia would be applying an all-inclusive approach to accommodate
        as many mobile access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general
        mobile access, including BlackBerry and the Windows Phone system, making market
        share a secondary issue.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> The latest version of

        Scientific use ===\nIn [[computational linguistics]], [[information retrieval]]
        and [[natural language processing]], Wikipedia has seen widespread use as
        a [[text corpus|corpus]] for linguistic research. In particular, it commonly
        serves as a target knowledge base for the [[entity linking]] problem, which
        is then called \"wikification\",<ref name=\"wikify\">Rada Mihalcea and Andras

        projects ==\nA number of interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating
        entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The
        first of these was the 1986 [[BBC Domesday Project]], which included text
        (entered on [[BBC Micro]] computers) and photographs from over 1&nbsp;million
        contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the
        UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the
        first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the
        majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK.
        The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated
        on a website until 2008.<ref name=\"Domesday Project\" />\n\nOne of the most
        successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public
        was [[h2g2]], which was created by [[Douglas Adams]]. The h2g2 encyclopedia
        is relatively light-hearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and
        informative. [[Everything2]] was created in 1998. All of these projects had
        similarities with Wikipedia, but were not wikis and neither gave full editorial
        privileges to public users.\n\n[[GNE (encyclopedia)|GNE]], an encyclopedia
        which was not a wiki, also created in January 2001, co-existed with Nupedia
        and Wikipedia early in its history; however, it has been retired.<ref name=\"stallman1999\"
        />\n\nOther websites centered on collaborative [[knowledge base]] development
        have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as [[Susning.nu]], [[Enciclopedia
        Libre Universal en Espa\u00f1ol|Enciclopedia Libre]], [[Hudong]], and [[Baidu
        Baike]] likewise employ no formal review process, although some like [[Conservapedia]]
        are not as open. Others use more traditional [[peer review]], such as [[Encyclopedia
        of Life]] and the online wiki encyclopedias [[Scholarpedia]] and [[Citizendium]].
        The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative
        to Wikipedia.<ref name=\"Orlowski18\" /><ref name=\"JayLyman\" />\n\n== See

        (long question period), somewhat outdated, and only an elite audience will
        understand all topics (certainly not a first-time reader of this article).
        Some topics: Visual editor (outdated), code review, wiki engines, MediaWiki''s
        database model, MediaWiki''s suitability for Wikimedia sites, AFD process,
        flagged revisions and proposed more advanced revision selection mechanisms,

        male \"star gods\" ''''[[Fu Lu Shou|F\u00fa, L\u00f9, Sh\u00f2u]]'''' are
        common in Chinese communities; compare [[Fu Manchu]], fictional character
        popular in the 1930s. ''''Smokey Stover'''' ran 1935\u201373, and continued
        to feature ''''foo'''' prominently, as on the front of the \"foomobile\" illustrated
        in the cover at right. The word ''''foo'''' became very popular in the 1930s,
        and also appeared in other cartoons including the ''''[[Looney Tunes]]''''
        cartoons of [[Bob Clampett]] such as ''''[[The Daffy Doc]]'''' and ''''[[Porky
        in Wackyland]]'''' (both 1938, with [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Porky Pig]]), and
        in other comic strips such as ''''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]''''.\n\nFrom there,
        the Foo migrated into military slang, merged with \"FU\" of the [[FUBAR]].<ref

        would find location \"foo\" and the location containing the \"add\" instruction

        \"Foo\" being conjoined with \"bar\" an addition borrowed from the military''s
        FUBAR. The use of ''''foo'''' in hacker and eventually in programming context
        may have begun in MIT''s [[Tech Model Railroad Club]] (TMRC). In the complex
        model system, there were [[scram]] switches located at numerous places around
        the room that could be thrown if something undesirable was about to occur,
        such as a train going full-bore at an obstruction. Another feature of the
        system was a digital clock on the dispatch board. When someone hit a scram
        switch the clock stopped and the display was replaced with the word \"FOO\";
        at TMRC the scram switches are therefore called \"Foo switches\". Because
        of this, an entry in the 1959 Dictionary of the TMRC Language went something
        like this: \"FOO: The first syllable of the misquoted sacred chant phrase
        ''[[Om mani padme hum|foo mane padme hum]].'' Our first obligation is to keep
        the foo counters turning.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computer-dictionary-online.org/?q=foo|title=Computer

        2010}} describing the MIT train room describes two buttons by the door: labelled
        foo and bar. These were general purpose buttons and were often re-purposed
        for whatever fun idea the MIT hackers had at the time, hence the adoption
        of foo and bar as general purpose variable names. An entry in the \"Abridged
        Dictionary of the TMRC Language\" states:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tmrc.mit.edu/dictionary.html|title=Abridged

        = Multiflush: stop-all-trains-button. Next best thing to the red door button.
        Also called FOO. Displays \"FOO\" on the clock when used.}}\n\nThe term ''''foobar''''
        was propagated through computer science circles in the 1960s and early 1970s
        by system manuals from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]].{{citation needed|date=May
        2009}} ''''Foobar'''' was also used as a variable name in the [[Fortran]]
        code of ''''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'''' (1977 Crowther and Woods version).
        The variable FOOBAR was used to contain the player''s progress in saying the
        magic phrase \"Fee Fie Foe Foo\".\n\nFoo''s use in code is indeed as a place
        holder for an as yet unnamed object. The fact that it is often followed by
        Bar as another placeholder is due to the popularity of the 1987 movie Lethal
        Weapon. In the movie the lead makes reference to FUBAR. Foo however is not
        the same as FU. Foo was originally from Foo Fighters and that a Foo is an
        unidentified object. Foo and Fubar have been conflated as the majority of
        people are unfamiliar with Foo Fighters.\n\n==Usage in code==\nThe terms are
        very often used in programming examples, much like the [[Hello World]] program
        is commonly used as an introduction.  For example, ''''foo'''' and ''''bar''''
        might be used to illustrate a simple string concatenation:\n\n<syntaxhighlight
        lang=\"c\">\n/* C code */\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main()\n{\n   char
        *foo = \"Hello\";\n   char *bar = \"World!\";\n   fprintf(stdout, \"%s %s\\n\",
        foo, bar);\n\n   return 0;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\nAlso see  [[metasyntactic
        variables#Programming language examples|metasyntactic variables]].\n\n==Usage
        in speech==\nThe terms are used in speech in an analogous way, although older
        synonyms may be used.  For example, \"''''Some function foo'''' will then
        be called\".  In these cases, ''''foo'''' and ''''bar'''' are synonyms for
        ''''whatever'''' or ''''whichever''''. Or: \"A database record for user ''''foo''''\"
        is synonymous with: \"A database record for user ''''whoever''''\".\n\n==Usage
        in culture==\n''''$foo'''' is the name of a [[Perl]] programming magazine,<ref>[http://foo-magazin.de/
        foo-magazin.de] {{de icon}}</ref> and [[Foo Camp]] is an annual [[hacker convention]].\n\nDuring
        the ''''[[United States v. Microsoft Corp.]]'''' trial, some evidence was
        presented that Microsoft had tried to use the [[Web Services Interoperability]]
        organization as a means to stifle competition, including e-mails in which
        top executives including [[Bill Gates]] referred to the WS-I using the codename
        \"foo\".<ref>[http://www.news.com/Microsoft-ploy-to-block-Sun-exposed/2100-1001_3-912906.html
        Microsoft ploy to block Sun exposed], news.com</ref>\n\nThese terms gave the
        name to [[foobar2000]], an audio player independently developed using C++,
        as its author was more focused on producing a functional program than on aesthetics.\n\nThere
        is a character named \"Master Foo\" in ''''Rootless Root'''', a collection
        of [[hacker koans]].\n\nGoogle releases https://google.com/foobar in November

        might be used to illustrate a simple string concatenation:\n\n<syntaxhighlight
        lang=\"c\">\n/* C code */\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main()\n{\n   char
        *foo = \"Hello\";\n   char *bar = \"World!\";\n   fprintf(stdout, \"%s %s\\n\",
        foo, bar);\n\n   return 0;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\nAlso see  [[metasyntactic
        variables#Programming language examples|metasyntactic variables]].\n\n==Usage
        in speech==\nThe terms are used in speech in an analogous way, although older
        synonyms may be used.  For example, \"''''Some function foo'''' will then
        be called\".  In these cases, ''''foo'''' and ''''bar'''' are synonyms for
        ''''whatever'''' or ''''whichever''''. Or: \"A database record for user ''''foo''''\"
        is synonymous with: \"A database record for user ''''whoever''''\".\n\n==Usage
        in culture==\n''''$foo'''' is the name of a [[Perl]] programming magazine,<ref>[http://foo-magazin.de/
        foo-magazin.de] {{de icon}}</ref> and [[Foo Camp]] is an annual [[hacker convention]].\n\nDuring
        the ''''[[United States v. Microsoft Corp.]]'''' trial, some evidence was
        presented that Microsoft had tried to use the [[Web Services Interoperability]]
        organization as a means to stifle competition, including e-mails in which
        top executives including [[Bill Gates]] referred to the WS-I using the codename
        \"foo\".<ref>[http://www.news.com/Microsoft-ploy-to-block-Sun-exposed/2100-1001_3-912906.html

        name to [[foobar2000]], an audio player independently developed using C++,
        as its author was more focused on producing a functional program than on aesthetics.\n\nThere
        is a character named \"Master Foo\" in ''''Rootless Root'''', a collection

        of \"Foo\"}}</ref> However, the precise relationship of these terms is not
        known with certainty, and several anecdotal theories have been advanced to
        identify them.\n\nThe etymology of ''''foo'''' is explored in the [[Internet
        Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) RFC 3092, which gives the earliest documented
        use as being in the 1930s comic ''''[[Smokey Stover]]'''' by [[Bill Holman

        smokey-stover.com]</ref><ref>http://members.aol.com/EOCostello/</ref> This
        is presumably as a transliteration of the [[fu character]] (f\u00fa, \u798f),
        which is a common character for fortune, and figurines of the trio of eponymous
        male \"star gods\" ''''[[Fu Lu Shou|F\u00fa, L\u00f9, Sh\u00f2u]]'''' are
        common in Chinese communities; compare [[Fu Manchu]], fictional character
        popular in the 1930s. ''''Smokey Stover'''' ran 1935\u201373, and continued
        to feature ''''foo'''' prominently, as on the front of the \"foomobile\" illustrated
        in the cover at right. The word ''''foo'''' became very popular in the 1930s,
        and also appeared in other cartoons including the ''''[[Looney Tunes]]''''
        cartoons of [[Bob Clampett]] such as ''''[[The Daffy Doc]]'''' and ''''[[Porky
        in Wackyland]]'''' (both 1938, with [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Porky Pig]]), and
        in other comic strips such as ''''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]''''.\n\nFrom there,
        the Foo migrated into military slang, merged with \"FU\" of the [[FUBAR]].<ref
        name=\"rfc3092\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3092.txt|title=Etymology

        would find location \"foo\" and the location containing the \"add\" instruction
        as well.}}</ref> ''''Foobar'''' may have come about as a result of the pre-existing
        \"Foo\" being conjoined with \"bar\" an addition borrowed from the military''s
        FUBAR. The use of ''''foo'''' in hacker and eventually in programming context
        may have begun in MIT''s [[Tech Model Railroad Club]] (TMRC). In the complex
        model system, there were [[scram]] switches located at numerous places around
        the room that could be thrown if something undesirable was about to occur,
        such as a train going full-bore at an obstruction. Another feature of the
        system was a digital clock on the dispatch board. When someone hit a scram
        switch the clock stopped and the display was replaced with the word \"FOO\";
        at TMRC the scram switches are therefore called \"Foo switches\". Because
        of this, an entry in the 1959 Dictionary of the TMRC Language went something
        like this: \"FOO: The first syllable of the misquoted sacred chant phrase
        ''[[Om mani padme hum|foo mane padme hum]].'' Our first obligation is to keep
        the foo counters turning.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computer-dictionary-online.org/?q=foo|title=Computer
        Dictionary Online}}, computer-dictionary-online.org</ref> One book{{which|date=November
        2010}} describing the MIT train room describes two buttons by the door: labelled
        foo and bar. These were general purpose buttons and were often re-purposed
        for whatever fun idea the MIT hackers had at the time, hence the adoption
        of foo and bar as general purpose variable names. An entry in the \"Abridged
        Dictionary of the TMRC Language\" states:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tmrc.mit.edu/dictionary.html|title=Abridged
        Dictionary of the TMRC Language|publisher=[[MIT]]}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text
        = Multiflush: stop-all-trains-button. Next best thing to the red door button.
        Also called FOO. Displays \"FOO\" on the clock when used.}}\n\nThe term ''''foobar''''
        was propagated through computer science circles in the 1960s and early 1970s
        by system manuals from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]].{{citation needed|date=May
        2009}} ''''Foobar'''' was also used as a variable name in the [[Fortran]]
        code of ''''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'''' (1977 Crowther and Woods version).
        The variable FOOBAR was used to contain the player''s progress in saying the
        magic phrase \"Fee Fie Foe Foo\".\n\nFoo''s use in code is indeed as a place
        holder for an as yet unnamed object. The fact that it is often followed by
        Bar as another placeholder is due to the popularity of the 1987 movie Lethal
        Weapon. In the movie the lead makes reference to FUBAR. Foo however is not
        the same as FU. Foo was originally from Foo Fighters and that a Foo is an
        unidentified object. Foo and Fubar have been conflated as the majority of
        people are unfamiliar with Foo Fighters.\n\n==Usage in code==\nThe terms are
        very often used in programming examples, much like the [[Hello World]] program
        is commonly used as an introduction.  For example, ''''foo'''' and ''''bar''''
        might be used to illustrate a simple string concatenation:\n\n<syntaxhighlight
        lang=\"c\">\n/* C code */\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main()\n{\n   char
        *foo = \"Hello\";\n   char *bar = \"World!\";\n   fprintf(stdout, \"%s %s\\n\",
        foo, bar);\n\n   return 0;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\nAlso see  [[metasyntactic
        variables#Programming language examples|metasyntactic variables]].\n\n==Usage
        in speech==\nThe terms are used in speech in an analogous way, although older
        synonyms may be used.  For example, \"''''Some function foo'''' will then
        be called\".  In these cases, ''''foo'''' and ''''bar'''' are synonyms for
        ''''whatever'''' or ''''whichever''''. Or: \"A database record for user ''''foo''''\"
        is synonymous with: \"A database record for user ''''whoever''''\".\n\n==Usage
        in culture==\n''''$foo'''' is the name of a [[Perl]] programming magazine,<ref>[http://foo-magazin.de/
        foo-magazin.de] {{de icon}}</ref> and [[Foo Camp]] is an annual [[hacker convention]].\n\nDuring
        the ''''[[United States v. Microsoft Corp.]]'''' trial, some evidence was
        presented that Microsoft had tried to use the [[Web Services Interoperability]]
        organization as a means to stifle competition, including e-mails in which
        top executives including [[Bill Gates]] referred to the WS-I using the codename
        \"foo\".<ref>[http://www.news.com/Microsoft-ploy-to-block-Sun-exposed/2100-1001_3-912906.html
        Microsoft ploy to block Sun exposed], news.com</ref>\n\nThese terms gave the
        name to [[foobar2000]], an audio player independently developed using C++,
        as its author was more focused on producing a functional program than on aesthetics.\n\nThere
        is a character named \"Master Foo\" in ''''Rootless Root'''', a collection
        of [[hacker koans]].\n\nGoogle releases https://google.com/foobar in November

        and [[command (computing)|command]]s whose purpose is unimportant and serve
        only to demonstrate a concept.  The words themselves have no meaning in this
        usage.  ''''Foobar'''' is sometimes used alone; ''''foo'''', ''''bar'''',
        and ''''baz'''' are sometimes used, when multiple entities are needed.\n\nThe
        usage in [[computer programming]] examples and [[pseudocode]] varies; in certain
        circles, it is used extensively, but many prefer descriptive names, while
        others prefer to use single letters.  [[Eric S. Raymond]] has called it an

        as a [[nonsense word]] from the 1930s, the military term [[FUBAR]] emerged
        in the 1940s, and the use of ''''foo'''' in a programming context is generally
        credited to the [[Tech Model Railroad Club]] (TMRC) of [[Massachusetts Institute
        of Technology|MIT]] from circa 1960.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3092.txt|title=Etymology
        of \"Foo\"}}</ref> However, the precise relationship of these terms is not
        known with certainty, and several anecdotal theories have been advanced to
        identify them.\n\nThe etymology of ''''foo'''' is explored in the [[Internet
        Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) RFC 3092, which gives the earliest documented
        use as being in the 1930s comic ''''[[Smokey Stover]]'''' by [[Bill Holman
        (cartoonist)|Bill Holman]], where it is used as a nonsense word.<ref name=\"jargon\">http://catb.org/jargon/html/F/foo.html
        foo</ref><ref>http://catb.org/jargon/html/index.html</ref> Holman states that
        he used the word due to having seen it on bottom of a jade Chinese figurine
        in [[Chinatown, San Francisco]], meaning \"good luck\".<ref>http://www.smokey-stover.com/history.html</ref><ref>[http://www.smokey-stover.com/
        smokey-stover.com]</ref><ref>http://members.aol.com/EOCostello/</ref> This
        is presumably as a transliteration of the [[fu character]] (f\u00fa, \u798f),
        which is a common character for fortune, and figurines of the trio of eponymous
        male \"star gods\" ''''[[Fu Lu Shou|F\u00fa, L\u00f9, Sh\u00f2u]]'''' are
        common in Chinese communities; compare [[Fu Manchu]], fictional character
        popular in the 1930s. ''''Smokey Stover'''' ran 1935\u201373, and continued
        to feature ''''foo'''' prominently, as on the front of the \"foomobile\" illustrated
        in the cover at right. The word ''''foo'''' became very popular in the 1930s,
        and also appeared in other cartoons including the ''''[[Looney Tunes]]''''
        cartoons of [[Bob Clampett]] such as ''''[[The Daffy Doc]]'''' and ''''[[Porky
        in Wackyland]]'''' (both 1938, with [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Porky Pig]]), and
        in other comic strips such as ''''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]''''.\n\nFrom there,
        the Foo migrated into military slang, merged with \"FU\" of the [[FUBAR]].<ref
        name=\"rfc3092\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3092.txt|title=Etymology

        was used by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] aircraft pilots in [[World War
        II]] to describe various [[unidentified flying object|UFOs]] or mysterious
        aerial phenomena.\n\nThe first known use of the terms in print in a programming
        context appears in a 1965 edition of MIT''s \"Tech Engineering News\".<ref>{{cite

        indirect addressing thru location \"foo\", and location \"foo\" contained
        the address of location \"foobar\", than an effective word search for \"foobar\"
        would find location \"foo\" and the location containing the \"add\" instruction
        as well.}}</ref> ''''Foobar'''' may have come about as a result of the pre-existing
        \"Foo\" being conjoined with \"bar\" an addition borrowed from the military''s
        FUBAR. The use of ''''foo'''' in hacker and eventually in programming context
        may have begun in MIT''s [[Tech Model Railroad Club]] (TMRC). In the complex
        model system, there were [[scram]] switches located at numerous places around
        the room that could be thrown if something undesirable was about to occur,
        such as a train going full-bore at an obstruction. Another feature of the
        system was a digital clock on the dispatch board. When someone hit a scram
        switch the clock stopped and the display was replaced with the word \"FOO\";
        at TMRC the scram switches are therefore called \"Foo switches\". Because
        of this, an entry in the 1959 Dictionary of the TMRC Language went something
        like this: \"FOO: The first syllable of the misquoted sacred chant phrase
        ''[[Om mani padme hum|foo mane padme hum]].'' Our first obligation is to keep
        the foo counters turning.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computer-dictionary-online.org/?q=foo|title=Computer
        Dictionary Online}}, computer-dictionary-online.org</ref> One book{{which|date=November
        2010}} describing the MIT train room describes two buttons by the door: labelled
        foo and bar. These were general purpose buttons and were often re-purposed
        for whatever fun idea the MIT hackers had at the time, hence the adoption
        of foo and bar as general purpose variable names. An entry in the \"Abridged
        Dictionary of the TMRC Language\" states:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tmrc.mit.edu/dictionary.html|title=Abridged
        Dictionary of the TMRC Language|publisher=[[MIT]]}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text
        = Multiflush: stop-all-trains-button. Next best thing to the red door button.
        Also called FOO. Displays \"FOO\" on the clock when used.}}\n\nThe term ''''foobar''''
        was propagated through computer science circles in the 1960s and early 1970s
        by system manuals from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]].{{citation needed|date=May
        2009}} ''''Foobar'''' was also used as a variable name in the [[Fortran]]
        code of ''''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'''' (1977 Crowther and Woods version).
        The variable FOOBAR was used to contain the player''s progress in saying the
        magic phrase \"Fee Fie Foe Foo\".\n\nFoo''s use in code is indeed as a place
        holder for an as yet unnamed object. The fact that it is often followed by
        Bar as another placeholder is due to the popularity of the 1987 movie Lethal
        Weapon. In the movie the lead makes reference to FUBAR. Foo however is not
        the same as FU. Foo was originally from Foo Fighters and that a Foo is an
        unidentified object. Foo and Fubar have been conflated as the majority of
        people are unfamiliar with Foo Fighters.\n\n==Usage in code==\nThe terms are
        very often used in programming examples, much like the [[Hello World]] program
        is commonly used as an introduction.  For example, ''''foo'''' and ''''bar''''
        might be used to illustrate a simple string concatenation:\n\n<syntaxhighlight

        foo, bar);\n\n   return 0;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\nAlso see  [[metasyntactic
        variables#Programming language examples|metasyntactic variables]].\n\n==Usage
        in speech==\nThe terms are used in speech in an analogous way, although older
        synonyms may be used.  For example, \"''''Some function foo'''' will then
        be called\".  In these cases, ''''foo'''' and ''''bar'''' are synonyms for
        ''''whatever'''' or ''''whichever''''. Or: \"A database record for user ''''foo''''\"
        is synonymous with: \"A database record for user ''''whoever''''\".\n\n==Usage
        in culture==\n''''$foo'''' is the name of a [[Perl]] programming magazine,<ref>[http://foo-magazin.de/
        foo-magazin.de] {{de icon}}</ref> and [[Foo Camp]] is an annual [[hacker convention]].\n\nDuring
        the ''''[[United States v. Microsoft Corp.]]'''' trial, some evidence was

        as a [[nonsense word]] from the 1930s, the military term [[FUBAR]] emerged
        in the 1940s, and the use of ''''foo'''' in a programming context is generally
        credited to the [[Tech Model Railroad Club]] (TMRC) of [[Massachusetts Institute
        of Technology|MIT]] from circa 1960.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3092.txt|title=Etymology
        of \"Foo\"}}</ref> However, the precise relationship of these terms is not
        known with certainty, and several anecdotal theories have been advanced to
        identify them.\n\nThe etymology of ''''foo'''' is explored in the [[Internet
        Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) RFC 3092, which gives the earliest documented
        use as being in the 1930s comic ''''[[Smokey Stover]]'''' by [[Bill Holman
        (cartoonist)|Bill Holman]], where it is used as a nonsense word.<ref name=\"jargon\">http://catb.org/jargon/html/F/foo.html
        foo</ref><ref>http://catb.org/jargon/html/index.html</ref> Holman states that
        he used the word due to having seen it on bottom of a jade Chinese figurine
        in [[Chinatown, San Francisco]], meaning \"good luck\".<ref>http://www.smokey-stover.com/history.html</ref><ref>[http://www.smokey-stover.com/
        smokey-stover.com]</ref><ref>http://members.aol.com/EOCostello/</ref> This
        is presumably as a transliteration of the [[fu character]] (f\u00fa, \u798f),
        which is a common character for fortune, and figurines of the trio of eponymous
        male \"star gods\" ''''[[Fu Lu Shou|F\u00fa, L\u00f9, Sh\u00f2u]]'''' are
        common in Chinese communities; compare [[Fu Manchu]], fictional character
        popular in the 1930s. ''''Smokey Stover'''' ran 1935\u201373, and continued
        to feature ''''foo'''' prominently, as on the front of the \"foomobile\" illustrated
        in the cover at right. The word ''''foo'''' became very popular in the 1930s,
        and also appeared in other cartoons including the ''''[[Looney Tunes]]''''
        cartoons of [[Bob Clampett]] such as ''''[[The Daffy Doc]]'''' and ''''[[Porky
        in Wackyland]]'''' (both 1938, with [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Porky Pig]]), and
        in other comic strips such as ''''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]''''.\n\nFrom there,
        the Foo migrated into military slang, merged with \"FU\" of the [[FUBAR]].<ref
        name=\"rfc3092\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3092.txt|title=Etymology

        the address of location \"foobar\", than an effective word search for \"foobar\"
        would find location \"foo\" and the location containing the \"add\" instruction
        as well.}}</ref> ''''Foobar'''' may have come about as a result of the pre-existing
        \"Foo\" being conjoined with \"bar\" an addition borrowed from the military''s
        FUBAR. The use of ''''foo'''' in hacker and eventually in programming context
        may have begun in MIT''s [[Tech Model Railroad Club]] (TMRC). In the complex
        model system, there were [[scram]] switches located at numerous places around
        the room that could be thrown if something undesirable was about to occur,
        such as a train going full-bore at an obstruction. Another feature of the
        system was a digital clock on the dispatch board. When someone hit a scram
        switch the clock stopped and the display was replaced with the word \"FOO\";
        at TMRC the scram switches are therefore called \"Foo switches\". Because
        of this, an entry in the 1959 Dictionary of the TMRC Language went something
        like this: \"FOO: The first syllable of the misquoted sacred chant phrase
        ''[[Om mani padme hum|foo mane padme hum]].'' Our first obligation is to keep
        the foo counters turning.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computer-dictionary-online.org/?q=foo|title=Computer
        Dictionary Online}}, computer-dictionary-online.org</ref> One book{{which|date=November
        2010}} describing the MIT train room describes two buttons by the door: labelled
        foo and bar. These were general purpose buttons and were often re-purposed
        for whatever fun idea the MIT hackers had at the time, hence the adoption
        of foo and bar as general purpose variable names. An entry in the \"Abridged
        Dictionary of the TMRC Language\" states:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tmrc.mit.edu/dictionary.html|title=Abridged
        Dictionary of the TMRC Language|publisher=[[MIT]]}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text
        = Multiflush: stop-all-trains-button. Next best thing to the red door button.
        Also called FOO. Displays \"FOO\" on the clock when used.}}\n\nThe term ''''foobar''''
        was propagated through computer science circles in the 1960s and early 1970s
        by system manuals from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]].{{citation needed|date=May
        2009}} ''''Foobar'''' was also used as a variable name in the [[Fortran]]
        code of ''''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'''' (1977 Crowther and Woods version).
        The variable FOOBAR was used to contain the player''s progress in saying the
        magic phrase \"Fee Fie Foe Foo\".\n\nFoo''s use in code is indeed as a place
        holder for an as yet unnamed object. The fact that it is often followed by
        Bar as another placeholder is due to the popularity of the 1987 movie Lethal
        Weapon. In the movie the lead makes reference to FUBAR. Foo however is not
        the same as FU. Foo was originally from Foo Fighters and that a Foo is an
        unidentified object. Foo and Fubar have been conflated as the majority of
        people are unfamiliar with Foo Fighters.\n\n==Usage in code==\nThe terms are
        very often used in programming examples, much like the [[Hello World]] program
        is commonly used as an introduction.  For example, ''''foo'''' and ''''bar''''
        might be used to illustrate a simple string concatenation:\n\n<syntaxhighlight
        lang=\"c\">\n/* C code */\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main()\n{\n   char
        *foo = \"Hello\";\n   char *bar = \"World!\";\n   fprintf(stdout, \"%s %s\\n\",
        foo, bar);\n\n   return 0;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\nAlso see  [[metasyntactic
        variables#Programming language examples|metasyntactic variables]].\n\n==Usage
        in speech==\nThe terms are used in speech in an analogous way, although older
        synonyms may be used.  For example, \"''''Some function foo'''' will then
        be called\".  In these cases, ''''foo'''' and ''''bar'''' are synonyms for
        ''''whatever'''' or ''''whichever''''. Or: \"A database record for user ''''foo''''\"
        is synonymous with: \"A database record for user ''''whoever''''\".\n\n==Usage
        in culture==\n''''$foo'''' is the name of a [[Perl]] programming magazine,<ref>[http://foo-magazin.de/
        foo-magazin.de] {{de icon}}</ref> and [[Foo Camp]] is an annual [[hacker convention]].\n\nDuring
        the ''''[[United States v. Microsoft Corp.]]'''' trial, some evidence was
        presented that Microsoft had tried to use the [[Web Services Interoperability]]
        organization as a means to stifle competition, including e-mails in which
        top executives including [[Bill Gates]] referred to the WS-I using the codename
        \"foo\".<ref>[http://www.news.com/Microsoft-ploy-to-block-Sun-exposed/2100-1001_3-912906.html
        Microsoft ploy to block Sun exposed], news.com</ref>\n\nThese terms gave the
        name to [[foobar2000]], an audio player independently developed using C++,
        as its author was more focused on producing a functional program than on aesthetics.\n\nThere
        is a character named \"Master Foo\" in ''''Rootless Root'''', a collection
        of [[hacker koans]].\n\nGoogle releases https://google.com/foobar in November
        2014.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Computer programming}}\n* [[BarCamp]], an
