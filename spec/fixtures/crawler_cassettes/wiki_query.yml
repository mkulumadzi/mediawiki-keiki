        The [[English Wikipedia]] is now one of more than 200 Wikipedias, but remains
        the largest one, with {{srlink|Wikipedia:Size of Wikipedia|over {{#expr:0.1*floor

        tend to show that Wikipedia's accuracy is similar to Encyclopedia Britannica,
        with Wikipedia being much larger. However, critics have worried that [[Criticism
        of Wikipedia#Systemic bias in coverage|Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias]],
        and that its [[group dynamics]] hinder its goals. Most [[Academia|academics]],
        [[historian]]s, [[teacher]]s and [[journalist]]s reject Wikipedia as a reliable
        source of information for being a mixture of truths, half truths, and some
        falsehoods,<ref name=EdwinBlack/> and that as a resource about controversial
        topics, Wikipedia is notoriously subject to manipulation and spin.<ref name=Petrilli/>
        Wikipedia's [[WP:consensus|Consensus]] and [[WP:Undue|Undue Weight]] policies
        have been repeatedly criticised by prominent scholarly sources for undermining
        [[freedom of thought]] and leading to false beliefs based on incomplete information.<ref

        articles, and any Wikipedia article could be edited by any reader, even those
        who did not have a Wikipedia account. Modifications to all articles would
        immediately become available. As a result, all articles could contain inaccuracies,
        ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text until an editor would
        correct these issues.\\n\\n=== Restrictions ===\\nOver time, the English Wikipedia
        and some other Wikipedias gradually restricted modifications. For example,
        in the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered
        users may create a new article.<ref>{{srlink|Wikipedia:Tutorial/Registration|Registration
        notes}}</ref> On the English Wikipedia and some others, some particularly
        sensitive and/or vandalism-prone pages are now \\\"protected\\\" to some degree.<ref

        the [[German Wikipedia]] maintains \\\"stable versions\\\" of articles,<ref

        made by others. The \\\"History\\\" page of each article links to each revision.<ref

        infringements [[WP:Suppression|may be removed completely]].</ref><ref name=\\\"Torsten_Kleinz\\\"

        the article's history page. Anyone can view the [[Help:Recent changes|latest

        obvious problems.<ref>[[Wikipedia:New pages patrol]]</ref>\\n\\nIn 2003, economics
        PhD student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low [[transaction cost]]s of
        participating in a [[wiki]] create a catalyst for collaborative development,
        and that features such as easy access to past versions of a page favor \\\"creative

        Wikipedia}}\\n\\nAny edit that changes content in a way that deliberately
        compromises the integrity of Wikipedia is considered vandalism. The most common
        and obvious types of vandalism include insertion of obscenities and crude
        humor. Vandalism can also include advertising language and other types of
        [[Wikipedia:Spam|spam]].<ref name=\\\"upenn link spamming 1\\\">[http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1508&context=cis_papers

        vandalism by removing information or entirely blanking a given page. Less
        common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but
        false information to an article, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals
        can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's
        title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an article, or
        use images disruptively.<ref name=\\\"WP vandalism manipulation 1\\\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Vandalism|Vandalism}}.

        [\\u2026] which explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as
        a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise.
        As a community, far from being elitist, it is anti-elitist (which, in this
        context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs
        and disrespect of expertise is tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy
        that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did

        Wikipedia was cited by ''The Economist'' as substantially in contrast to statistics
        for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). ''The Economist''
        reported that the number of contributors with an average of five of more edits
        per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages
        at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about
        2,000 editors up or down. The attrition rates for editors in English Wikipedia,
        by sharp comparison, were cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000
        editors which has dropped to 30,000 editors as of the start of 2014. At the
        quoted trend rate, the number of active editors in English Wikipedia has lost
        approximately 20,000 editors to attrition since 2007, and the documented trend
        rate indicates the loss of another 20,000 editors by 2021, down to 10,000
        active editors on English Wikipedia by 2021 if left unabated.<ref name=\\\"economist1\\\"
        /> Given that the trend analysis published in ''The Economist'' presents the
        number of active editors for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia)
        as remaining relatively constant and successful in sustaining its numbers
        at approximately 42,000 active editors, the contrast has pointed to the effectiveness
        of Wikipedia in other languages to retain its active editors on a renewable
        and sustained basis.<ref name=\\\"economist1\\\" /> No comment was made concerning
        which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other
        languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to

        are factually accurate, they are often written in a poor, almost unreadable

        His research examined the [[counterproductive work behavior]] of edit warring.
        Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \\\"undo\\\" operations were not
        the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and
        relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting \\\"reverting/reverted
        pairs\\\" or \\\"mutually reverting edit pairs.\\\" Such a \\\"mutually reverting
        edit pair\\\" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor
        who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the \\\"mutually
        reverting edit pairs.\\\" The results were tabulated for all language versions
        of Wikipedia, with the English Wikipedia three largest conflict rates applying
        to articles about (i) ''G.W. Bush'', (ii) ''Anarchism'' and (iii) ''Mohammad''.<ref

        [[Porter five forces analysis]] framework for industry analysis, Wikipedia
        and its parent institution Wikimedia are known as \\\"first movers\\\" and
        \\\"radical innovators\\\" in the services provided and supported by an open-source,
        on-line encyclopedia.<ref name=\\\"Porter, M.E. 1985\\\">Porter, M.E. (1985)
        Competitive Advantage, Free Press, New York, 1985.</ref> The \\\"five forces\\\"
        are centered around the issue of \\\"competitive rivalry\\\" within the encyclopedia
        industry where Wikipedia is seen as having redefined by its \\\"radical innovation\\\"
        the parameters of effectiveness applied to conventional encyclopedia publication.
        This is the first force of Porter's five forces analysis.<ref name=\\\"Porter,
        M.E. 1980\\\">Porter, M.E. (1980) Competitive Strategy, Free Press, New York,
        1980.</ref> The second force is the \\\"threat of new entrants\\\" with competitive
        services and products possibly arising on the internet or the web. As a \\\"first
        mover\\\", Wikipedia has largely eluded the emergence of a [[fast second]]
        to challenge its radical innovation and its standing as the central provider
        of the services which it offers through the World Wide Web.<ref>Markides,
        Constantinos (2005). Fast Second, Wiley&Sons Inc., San Francisco, 2005</ref>
        Porter's third force is the \\\"threat of substitute products\\\" and it is
        too early to identify Google's \\\"Knowledge Graphs\\\" as an effective competitor
        given the current dependence of \\\"Knowledge Graphs\\\" upon Wikipedia's
        free access to its open-source services.<ref name=\\\"Porter, M.E. 1985\\\"
        /> The fourth force in the [[Porter five forces analysis]] is the \\\"bargaining
        power of consumers\\\" who use the services provided by Wikipedia, which has
        historically largely been nullified by the Wikipedia founding principle of
        an open invitation to expand and edit its content expressed in its moniker
        of being \\\"the encyclopedia which anyone can edit.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Porter,
        M.E. 1980\\\" /> The fifth force in the [[Porter five forces analysis]] is
        defined as the \\\"bargaining power of suppliers\\\", presently seen as the
        open domain of both the global internet as a whole and the resources of public
        libraries world-wide, and therefore it is not seen as a limiting factor in
        the immediate future of the further development of Wikipedia.<ref name=\\\"Porter,

        started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by [[GNU Free Documentation
        License]] (GFDL), a [[copyleft]] license permitting the redistribution, creation
        of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright
        of their work.<ref name=\\\"WP copyright and commerciality 1\\\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Copyrights}}</ref>
        GFDL was created for software manuals that come with [[free software]] programs
        licensed under [[GPL]]. This made it a poor choice for a general reference
        work; for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia
        to come with a full copy of the GFDL license text. In December 2002, the [[Creative
        Commons license]] was released: it was specifically designed for creative
        works in general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity
        among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia
        project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.<ref name=\\\"WPF switch

        incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the
        [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) released a new version of GFDL designed
        specifically to allow Wikipedia to {{srlink|Wikipedia:Licensing update|relicense
        its content to CC BY-SA}} by August 1, 2009. (A new version of GFDL automatically
        covers Wikipedia contents.) In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects
        held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.<ref

        across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia,
        include non-free image files under [[fair use]] doctrine, while the others
        have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their
        home countries (e.g. in [[Copyright law of Japan|Japanese copyright law]]).
        Media files covered by [[free content]] licenses (e.g. Creative Commons' CC
        BY-SA) are shared across language editions via [[Wikimedia Commons]] repository,
        a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia's accommodation
        of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe

        The website [[DBpedia]], begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and

        the [[Wikidata]] project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts
        from each page of Wikipedia and the other WMF wikis and make it available
        in a queriable [[Semantic Web|semantic]] format, [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]].
        This is still under development. As of Feb 2014 it has 15,000,000 items and
        1,000 properties for describing them.\\n\\nObtaining the full contents of

        through a fixed [[internet access|Internet connection]]. Although Wikipedia
        content has been accessible through the [[mobile web]] since July 2013, ''The
        New York Times'' on 9 February 2014 quoted Erik Moller, deputy director of
        the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic
        from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and
        worry.<ref name=\\\"small screen\\\" /> The ''The New York Times'' article
        reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, \\\"Only
        20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile
        devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic
        for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to
        mobile editing has lagged even more.\\\"<ref name=\\\"small screen\\\" />
        ''The New York Times'' reports that Mr. Moller of Wikimedia has assigned \\\"a
        team of 10 software developers focused on mobile,\\\" out of a total of approximately
        200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited
        by ''The New York Times'' for the \\\"worry\\\" is for Wikipedia to effectively
        address attrition issues with the number of editors which the on-line encyclopedia
        attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment.<ref

        Directly after the posted web interview, the representatives stated that Wikimedia
        would be applying an all-inclusive approach to accommodate as many mobile
        access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general mobile access,
        including BlackBerry and the Windows Phone system, making market share a secondary

        ==\\nA number of interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries
        written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first
        of these was the 1986 [[BBC Domesday Project]], which included text (entered
        on [[BBC Micro]] computers) and photographs from over 1&nbsp;million contributors
        in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was
        the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major
        multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of
        articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface
        and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website
        until 2008.<ref name=\\\"Domesday Project\\\" />\\n\\nOne of the most successful
        early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was [[h2g2]],
        which was created by [[Douglas Adams]]. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively
        light-hearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.
        [[Everything2]] was created in 1998. All of these projects had similarities
        with Wikipedia, but were not wikis and neither gave full editorial privileges
        to public users.\\n\\n[[GNE (encyclopedia)|GNE]], an encyclopedia which was
        not a wiki, also created in January 2001, co-existed with Nupedia and Wikipedia
        early in its history; however, it has been retired.<ref name=\\\"stallman1999\\\"
        />\\n\\nOther websites centered on collaborative [[knowledge base]] development
        have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as [[Susning.nu]], [[Enciclopedia
        Libre Universal en Espa\\u00f1ol|Enciclopedia Libre]], [[Hudong]], and [[Baidu
        Baike]] likewise employ no formal review process, although some like [[Conservapedia]]
        are not as open. Others use more traditional [[peer review]], such as [[Encyclopedia
        of Life]] and the online wiki encyclopedias [[Scholarpedia]] and [[Citizendium]].
        The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative

        long, in large part about the future (development), not presented with structure
        (long question period), somewhat outdated, and only an elite audience will
        understand all topics (certainly not a first-time reader of this article).
        Some topics: Visual editor (outdated), code review, wiki engines, MediaWiki's
        database model, MediaWiki's suitability for Wikimedia sites, AFD process,
        flagged revisions and proposed more advanced revision selection mechanisms,

        through the launch of versions in different languages. All versions of Wikipedia

        The [[English Wikipedia]] is now one of more than 200 Wikipedias, but remains
        the largest one, with {{srlink|Wikipedia:Size of Wikipedia|over {{#expr:0.1*floor

        tend to show that Wikipedia's accuracy is similar to Encyclopedia Britannica,
        with Wikipedia being much larger. However, critics have worried that [[Criticism
        of Wikipedia#Systemic bias in coverage|Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias]],
        and that its [[group dynamics]] hinder its goals. Most [[Academia|academics]],
        [[historian]]s, [[teacher]]s and [[journalist]]s reject Wikipedia as a reliable
        source of information for being a mixture of truths, half truths, and some
        falsehoods,<ref name=EdwinBlack/> and that as a resource about controversial
        topics, Wikipedia is notoriously subject to manipulation and spin.<ref name=Petrilli/>
        Wikipedia's [[WP:consensus|Consensus]] and [[WP:Undue|Undue Weight]] policies
        have been repeatedly criticised by prominent scholarly sources for undermining

        who did not have a Wikipedia account. Modifications to all articles would

        ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text until an editor would
        correct these issues.\\n\\n=== Restrictions ===\\nOver time, the English Wikipedia
        and some other Wikipedias gradually restricted modifications. For example,
        in the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered
        users may create a new article.<ref>{{srlink|Wikipedia:Tutorial/Registration|Registration

        compromises the integrity of Wikipedia is considered vandalism. The most common
        and obvious types of vandalism include insertion of obscenities and crude
        humor. Vandalism can also include advertising language and other types of
        [[Wikipedia:Spam|spam]].<ref name=\\\"upenn link spamming 1\\\">[http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1508&context=cis_papers

        vandalism by removing information or entirely blanking a given page. Less
        common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but
        false information to an article, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals
        can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's
        title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an article, or
        use images disruptively.<ref name=\\\"WP vandalism manipulation 1\\\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Vandalism|Vandalism}}.

        anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problem
        [\\u2026] which explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as
        a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise.
        As a community, far from being elitist, it is anti-elitist (which, in this
        context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs
        and disrespect of expertise is tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy
        that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did
        not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely

        Wikipedia was cited by ''The Economist'' as substantially in contrast to statistics
        for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). ''The Economist''
        reported that the number of contributors with an average of five of more edits
        per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages
        at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about
        2,000 editors up or down. The attrition rates for editors in English Wikipedia,
        by sharp comparison, were cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000
        editors which has dropped to 30,000 editors as of the start of 2014. At the
        quoted trend rate, the number of active editors in English Wikipedia has lost
        approximately 20,000 editors to attrition since 2007, and the documented trend
        rate indicates the loss of another 20,000 editors by 2021, down to 10,000
        active editors on English Wikipedia by 2021 if left unabated.<ref name=\\\"economist1\\\"
        /> Given that the trend analysis published in ''The Economist'' presents the
        number of active editors for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia)
        as remaining relatively constant and successful in sustaining its numbers
        at approximately 42,000 active editors, the contrast has pointed to the effectiveness
        of Wikipedia in other languages to retain its active editors on a renewable
        and sustained basis.<ref name=\\\"economist1\\\" /> No comment was made concerning
        which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other
        languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to

        His research examined the [[counterproductive work behavior]] of edit warring.
        Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \\\"undo\\\" operations were not
        the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and
        relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting \\\"reverting/reverted
        pairs\\\" or \\\"mutually reverting edit pairs.\\\" Such a \\\"mutually reverting
        edit pair\\\" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor
        who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the \\\"mutually
        reverting edit pairs.\\\" The results were tabulated for all language versions
        of Wikipedia, with the English Wikipedia three largest conflict rates applying
        to articles about (i) ''G.W. Bush'', (ii) ''Anarchism'' and (iii) ''Mohammad''.<ref

        largest conflict rates at the time of the Oxford study were for the articles

        interview with spokesman Jay Walsh of Wikimedia who \\\"said Tretikov would
        address that issue (paid advocacy) as a priority. 'We are really pushing toward
        more transparency... We are reinforcing that paid advocacy is not welcome.'
        Initiatives to involve greater diversity of contributors, better mobile support
        of Wikipedia, new geo-location tools to find local content more easily, and
        more tools for users in the second and third world are also priorities, Walsh

        upon the [[MySQL]] database system.<ref name=\\\"nedworks database system\\\">{{cite

        [[Macro (computer science)|macro language]], [[variable (programming)|variables]],
        a [[transclusion]] system for [[Web template|templates]], and [[URL redirection]].
        MediaWiki is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] and it is used
        by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. Originally,
        Wikipedia ran on [[UseModWiki]] written in [[Perl]] by Clifford Adams (Phase
        I), which initially required [[CamelCase]] for article hyperlinks; the present
        double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase
        II), Wikipedia began running on a [[PhpWiki|PHP wiki]] engine with a MySQL
        database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by [[Magnus Manske]].
        The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the [[Exponential
        growth|exponentially increasing]] demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia
        shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by
        [[Lee Daniel Crocker]].\\n\\nSeveral MediaWiki extensions are installed<ref

        [[Porter five forces analysis]] framework for industry analysis, Wikipedia
        and its parent institution Wikimedia are known as \\\"first movers\\\" and
        \\\"radical innovators\\\" in the services provided and supported by an open-source,
        on-line encyclopedia.<ref name=\\\"Porter, M.E. 1985\\\">Porter, M.E. (1985)
        Competitive Advantage, Free Press, New York, 1985.</ref> The \\\"five forces\\\"
        are centered around the issue of \\\"competitive rivalry\\\" within the encyclopedia
        industry where Wikipedia is seen as having redefined by its \\\"radical innovation\\\"
        the parameters of effectiveness applied to conventional encyclopedia publication.
        This is the first force of Porter's five forces analysis.<ref name=\\\"Porter,
        M.E. 1980\\\">Porter, M.E. (1980) Competitive Strategy, Free Press, New York,
        1980.</ref> The second force is the \\\"threat of new entrants\\\" with competitive
        services and products possibly arising on the internet or the web. As a \\\"first
        mover\\\", Wikipedia has largely eluded the emergence of a [[fast second]]
        to challenge its radical innovation and its standing as the central provider
        of the services which it offers through the World Wide Web.<ref>Markides,
        Constantinos (2005). Fast Second, Wiley&Sons Inc., San Francisco, 2005</ref>
        Porter's third force is the \\\"threat of substitute products\\\" and it is
        too early to identify Google's \\\"Knowledge Graphs\\\" as an effective competitor
        given the current dependence of \\\"Knowledge Graphs\\\" upon Wikipedia's
        free access to its open-source services.<ref name=\\\"Porter, M.E. 1985\\\"
        /> The fourth force in the [[Porter five forces analysis]] is the \\\"bargaining
        power of consumers\\\" who use the services provided by Wikipedia, which has
        historically largely been nullified by the Wikipedia founding principle of
        an open invitation to expand and edit its content expressed in its moniker
        of being \\\"the encyclopedia which anyone can edit.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Porter,
        M.E. 1980\\\" /> The fifth force in the [[Porter five forces analysis]] is
        defined as the \\\"bargaining power of suppliers\\\", presently seen as the
        open domain of both the global internet as a whole and the resources of public
        libraries world-wide, and therefore it is not seen as a limiting factor in
        the immediate future of the further development of Wikipedia.<ref name=\\\"Porter,

        Access to content ==\\n\\n=== Content licensing ===\\nWhen the project was
        started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by [[GNU Free Documentation
        License]] (GFDL), a [[copyleft]] license permitting the redistribution, creation
        of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright
        of their work.<ref name=\\\"WP copyright and commerciality 1\\\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Copyrights}}</ref>
        GFDL was created for software manuals that come with [[free software]] programs
        licensed under [[GPL]]. This made it a poor choice for a general reference
        work; for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia
        to come with a full copy of the GFDL license text. In December 2002, the [[Creative
        Commons license]] was released: it was specifically designed for creative
        works in general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity
        among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia
        project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.<ref name=\\\"WPF switch

        incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the
        [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) released a new version of GFDL designed
        specifically to allow Wikipedia to {{srlink|Wikipedia:Licensing update|relicense
        its content to CC BY-SA}} by August 1, 2009. (A new version of GFDL automatically
        covers Wikipedia contents.) In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects
        held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.<ref

        across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia,
        include non-free image files under [[fair use]] doctrine, while the others
        have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their
        home countries (e.g. in [[Copyright law of Japan|Japanese copyright law]]).
        Media files covered by [[free content]] licenses (e.g. Creative Commons' CC
        BY-SA) are shared across language editions via [[Wikimedia Commons]] repository,
        a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia's accommodation
        of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe

        The website [[DBpedia]], begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and

        the [[Wikidata]] project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts
        from each page of Wikipedia and the other WMF wikis and make it available
        in a queriable [[Semantic Web|semantic]] format, [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]].
        This is still under development. As of Feb 2014 it has 15,000,000 items and

        reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, \\\"Only
        20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile
        devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic
        for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to

        200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited

        ==\\nA number of interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries
        written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first
        of these was the 1986 [[BBC Domesday Project]], which included text (entered
        on [[BBC Micro]] computers) and photographs from over 1&nbsp;million contributors
        in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was
        the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major
        multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of
        articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface
        and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website
        until 2008.<ref name=\\\"Domesday Project\\\" />\\n\\nOne of the most successful
        early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was [[h2g2]],
        which was created by [[Douglas Adams]]. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively
        light-hearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.
        [[Everything2]] was created in 1998. All of these projects had similarities
        with Wikipedia, but were not wikis and neither gave full editorial privileges
        to public users.\\n\\n[[GNE (encyclopedia)|GNE]], an encyclopedia which was
        not a wiki, also created in January 2001, co-existed with Nupedia and Wikipedia
        early in its history; however, it has been retired.<ref name=\\\"stallman1999\\\"
        />\\n\\nOther websites centered on collaborative [[knowledge base]] development
        have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as [[Susning.nu]], [[Enciclopedia
        Libre Universal en Espa\\u00f1ol|Enciclopedia Libre]], [[Hudong]], and [[Baidu
        Baike]] likewise employ no formal review process, although some like [[Conservapedia]]
        are not as open. Others use more traditional [[peer review]], such as [[Encyclopedia
        of Life]] and the online wiki encyclopedias [[Scholarpedia]] and [[Citizendium]].
        The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative
        to Wikipedia.<ref name=\\\"Orlowski18\\\" /><ref name=\\\"JayLyman\\\" />\\n\\n==

        content was initially only in English, it quickly became [[multilingualism|multilingual]],
        through the launch of versions in different languages. All versions of Wikipedia
        are similar, but important differences exist in content and in editing practices.
        The [[English Wikipedia]] is now one of more than 200 Wikipedias, but remains
        the largest one, with {{srlink|Wikipedia:Size of Wikipedia|over {{#expr:0.1*floor
        ({{NUMBEROFARTICLES:R}}/100000)}} million}} articles. As of February 2014,
        it had 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors each month.<ref

        tend to show that Wikipedia's accuracy is similar to Encyclopedia Britannica,
        with Wikipedia being much larger. However, critics have worried that [[Criticism
        of Wikipedia#Systemic bias in coverage|Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias]],
        and that its [[group dynamics]] hinder its goals. Most [[Academia|academics]],
        [[historian]]s, [[teacher]]s and [[journalist]]s reject Wikipedia as a reliable
        source of information for being a mixture of truths, half truths, and some
        falsehoods,<ref name=EdwinBlack/> and that as a resource about controversial
        topics, Wikipedia is notoriously subject to manipulation and spin.<ref name=Petrilli/>
        Wikipedia's [[WP:consensus|Consensus]] and [[WP:Undue|Undue Weight]] policies
        have been repeatedly criticised by prominent scholarly sources for undermining
        [[freedom of thought]] and leading to false beliefs based on incomplete information.<ref

        articles, and any Wikipedia article could be edited by any reader, even those
        who did not have a Wikipedia account. Modifications to all articles would
        immediately become available. As a result, all articles could contain inaccuracies,
        ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text until an editor would
        correct these issues.\\n\\n=== Restrictions ===\\nOver time, the English Wikipedia
        and some other Wikipedias gradually restricted modifications. For example,
        in the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered
        users may create a new article.<ref>{{srlink|Wikipedia:Tutorial/Registration|Registration
        notes}}</ref> On the English Wikipedia and some others, some particularly
        sensitive and/or vandalism-prone pages are now \\\"protected\\\" to some degree.<ref

        able to make changes.<ref>{{srlink|Wikipedia:Full protection|English Wikipedia's

        to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors. For example,
        the [[German Wikipedia]] maintains \\\"stable versions\\\" of articles,<ref
        name=\\\"WP some sites stable versions 1\\\">{{cite mailing list|first=P.|last=Birken|url=http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikide-l/2008-December/021594.html|title=Bericht

        vandalism by removing information or entirely blanking a given page. Less
        common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but
        false information to an article, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals
        can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's
        title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an article, or
        use images disruptively.<ref name=\\\"WP vandalism manipulation 1\\\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Vandalism|Vandalism}}.

        outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount
        their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs:
        the contributor is expected to build a user page, learn Wikipedia-specific

        at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about
        2,000 editors up or down. The attrition rates for editors in English Wikipedia,
        by sharp comparison, were cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000
        editors which has dropped to 30,000 editors as of the start of 2014. At the
        quoted trend rate, the number of active editors in English Wikipedia has lost
        approximately 20,000 editors to attrition since 2007, and the documented trend
        rate indicates the loss of another 20,000 editors by 2021, down to 10,000
        active editors on English Wikipedia by 2021 if left unabated.<ref name=\\\"economist1\\\"

        number of active editors for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia)
        as remaining relatively constant and successful in sustaining its numbers
        at approximately 42,000 active editors, the contrast has pointed to the effectiveness
        of Wikipedia in other languages to retain its active editors on a renewable
        and sustained basis.<ref name=\\\"economist1\\\" /> No comment was made concerning
        which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other

        the article, he pointed out its \\\"waffling\\\" conclusion: \\\"Some historians

        are factually accurate, they are often written in a poor, almost unreadable
        style. Frequent Wikipedia critic Andrew Orlowski commented: \\\"Even when
        a Wikipedia entry is 100 per cent factually correct, and those facts have

        His research examined the [[counterproductive work behavior]] of edit warring.
        Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \\\"undo\\\" operations were not
        the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and
        relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting \\\"reverting/reverted
        pairs\\\" or \\\"mutually reverting edit pairs.\\\" Such a \\\"mutually reverting
        edit pair\\\" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor
        who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the \\\"mutually
        reverting edit pairs.\\\" The results were tabulated for all language versions
        of Wikipedia, with the English Wikipedia three largest conflict rates applying
        to articles about (i) ''G.W. Bush'', (ii) ''Anarchism'' and (iii) ''Mohammad''.<ref

        largest conflict rates at the time of the Oxford study were for the articles

        MediaWiki is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] and it is used
        by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. Originally,
        Wikipedia ran on [[UseModWiki]] written in [[Perl]] by Clifford Adams (Phase
        I), which initially required [[CamelCase]] for article hyperlinks; the present
        double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase
        II), Wikipedia began running on a [[PhpWiki|PHP wiki]] engine with a MySQL
        database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by [[Magnus Manske]].
        The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the [[Exponential
        growth|exponentially increasing]] demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia
        shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by
        [[Lee Daniel Crocker]].\\n\\nSeveral MediaWiki extensions are installed<ref

        [[Porter five forces analysis]] framework for industry analysis, Wikipedia
        and its parent institution Wikimedia are known as \\\"first movers\\\" and
        \\\"radical innovators\\\" in the services provided and supported by an open-source,
        on-line encyclopedia.<ref name=\\\"Porter, M.E. 1985\\\">Porter, M.E. (1985)
        Competitive Advantage, Free Press, New York, 1985.</ref> The \\\"five forces\\\"
        are centered around the issue of \\\"competitive rivalry\\\" within the encyclopedia
        industry where Wikipedia is seen as having redefined by its \\\"radical innovation\\\"
        the parameters of effectiveness applied to conventional encyclopedia publication.
        This is the first force of Porter's five forces analysis.<ref name=\\\"Porter,
        M.E. 1980\\\">Porter, M.E. (1980) Competitive Strategy, Free Press, New York,
        1980.</ref> The second force is the \\\"threat of new entrants\\\" with competitive
        services and products possibly arising on the internet or the web. As a \\\"first
        mover\\\", Wikipedia has largely eluded the emergence of a [[fast second]]
        to challenge its radical innovation and its standing as the central provider
        of the services which it offers through the World Wide Web.<ref>Markides,
        Constantinos (2005). Fast Second, Wiley&Sons Inc., San Francisco, 2005</ref>
        Porter's third force is the \\\"threat of substitute products\\\" and it is
        too early to identify Google's \\\"Knowledge Graphs\\\" as an effective competitor
        given the current dependence of \\\"Knowledge Graphs\\\" upon Wikipedia's
        free access to its open-source services.<ref name=\\\"Porter, M.E. 1985\\\"
        /> The fourth force in the [[Porter five forces analysis]] is the \\\"bargaining
        power of consumers\\\" who use the services provided by Wikipedia, which has
        historically largely been nullified by the Wikipedia founding principle of
        an open invitation to expand and edit its content expressed in its moniker
        of being \\\"the encyclopedia which anyone can edit.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Porter,
        M.E. 1980\\\" /> The fifth force in the [[Porter five forces analysis]] is
        defined as the \\\"bargaining power of suppliers\\\", presently seen as the
        open domain of both the global internet as a whole and the resources of public
        libraries world-wide, and therefore it is not seen as a limiting factor in
        the immediate future of the further development of Wikipedia.<ref name=\\\"Porter,

        of specific WikiProjects like [[Wikipedia:BUGLE|''The Bugle'']] from [[WP:Milhist|WikiProject
        Military History]] and the monthly newsletter from [[WP:GOCE|The Guild of

        Access to content ==\\n\\n=== Content licensing ===\\nWhen the project was
        started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by [[GNU Free Documentation
        License]] (GFDL), a [[copyleft]] license permitting the redistribution, creation
        of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright
        of their work.<ref name=\\\"WP copyright and commerciality 1\\\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Copyrights}}</ref>
        GFDL was created for software manuals that come with [[free software]] programs
        licensed under [[GPL]]. This made it a poor choice for a general reference
        work; for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia
        to come with a full copy of the GFDL license text. In December 2002, the [[Creative
        Commons license]] was released: it was specifically designed for creative
        works in general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity
        among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia
        project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.<ref name=\\\"WPF switch

        update|year=2007|author=Walter Vermeir|publisher=Wikizine|accessdate=December
        4, 2007}}</ref> Because the two licenses, GFDL and Creative Commons, were
        incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the
        [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) released a new version of GFDL designed
        specifically to allow Wikipedia to {{srlink|Wikipedia:Licensing update|relicense
        its content to CC BY-SA}} by August 1, 2009. (A new version of GFDL automatically
        covers Wikipedia contents.) In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects
        held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.<ref

        across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia,
        include non-free image files under [[fair use]] doctrine, while the others
        have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their
        home countries (e.g. in [[Copyright law of Japan|Japanese copyright law]]).
        Media files covered by [[free content]] licenses (e.g. Creative Commons' CC
        BY-SA) are shared across language editions via [[Wikimedia Commons]] repository,
        a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia's accommodation
        of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe
        that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic

        The website [[DBpedia]], begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and

        the [[Wikidata]] project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts
        from each page of Wikipedia and the other WMF wikis and make it available
        in a queriable [[Semantic Web|semantic]] format, [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]].
        This is still under development. As of Feb 2014 it has 15,000,000 items and
        1,000 properties for describing them.\\n\\nObtaining the full contents of

        content has been accessible through the [[mobile web]] since July 2013, ''The

        reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, \\\"Only
        20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile
        devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic
        for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to
        mobile editing has lagged even more.\\\"<ref name=\\\"small screen\\\" />

        200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited

        Wikipedia comes from Google,<ref name=\\\"hitwisegoogle\\\" /> a good portion
        of which is related to academic research.<ref name=\\\"hitwiseAcademic\\\"

        Scientific use ===\\nIn [[computational linguistics]], [[information retrieval]]
        and [[natural language processing]], Wikipedia has seen widespread use as
        a [[text corpus|corpus]] for linguistic research. In particular, it commonly
        serves as a target knowledge base for the [[entity linking]] problem, which
        is then called \\\"wikification\\\",<ref name=\\\"wikify\\\">Rada Mihalcea

        ==\\nA number of interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries
        written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first
        of these was the 1986 [[BBC Domesday Project]], which included text (entered
        on [[BBC Micro]] computers) and photographs from over 1&nbsp;million contributors
        in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was
        the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major
        multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of
        articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface
        and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website
        until 2008.<ref name=\\\"Domesday Project\\\" />\\n\\nOne of the most successful
        early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was [[h2g2]],
        which was created by [[Douglas Adams]]. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively
        light-hearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.
        [[Everything2]] was created in 1998. All of these projects had similarities
        with Wikipedia, but were not wikis and neither gave full editorial privileges
        to public users.\\n\\n[[GNE (encyclopedia)|GNE]], an encyclopedia which was
        not a wiki, also created in January 2001, co-existed with Nupedia and Wikipedia
        early in its history; however, it has been retired.<ref name=\\\"stallman1999\\\"
        />\\n\\nOther websites centered on collaborative [[knowledge base]] development
        have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as [[Susning.nu]], [[Enciclopedia
        Libre Universal en Espa\\u00f1ol|Enciclopedia Libre]], [[Hudong]], and [[Baidu
        Baike]] likewise employ no formal review process, although some like [[Conservapedia]]
        are not as open. Others use more traditional [[peer review]], such as [[Encyclopedia
        of Life]] and the online wiki encyclopedias [[Scholarpedia]] and [[Citizendium]].
        The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative
        to Wikipedia.<ref name=\\\"Orlowski18\\\" /><ref name=\\\"JayLyman\\\" />\\n\\n==

        the use of ''foo'' in a programming context is generally credited to the [[Tech

        from circa 1960.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3092.txt|title=Etymology

        not known with certainty, and several anecdotal theories have been advanced
        to identify them.\\n\\nThe etymology of ''foo'' is explored in the [[Internet
        Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) RFC 3092, which gives the earliest documented
        use as being in the 1930s comic ''[[Smokey Stover]]'' by [[Bill Holman (cartoonist)|Bill

        male \\\"star gods\\\" ''[[Fu Lu Shou|F\\u00fa, L\\u00f9, Sh\\u00f2u]]'' are
        common in Chinese communities; compare [[Fu Manchu]], fictional character
        popular in the 1930s. ''Smokey Stover'' ran 1935\\u201373, and continued to
        feature ''foo'' prominently, as on the front of the \\\"foomobile\\\" illustrated
        in the cover at right. The word ''foo'' became very popular in the 1930s,
        and also appeared in other cartoons including the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoons
        of [[Bob Clampett]] such as ''[[The Daffy Doc]]'' and ''[[Porky in Wackyland]]''
        (both 1938, with [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Porky Pig]]), and in other comic strips
        such as ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]''.\\n\\nFrom there, the Foo migrated into
        military slang, merged with \\\"FU\\\" of the [[FUBAR]].<ref name=\\\"rfc3092\\\">{{cite

        the address of location \\\"foobar\\\", than an effective word search for
        \\\"foobar\\\" would find location \\\"foo\\\" and the location containing
        the \\\"add\\\" instruction as well.}}</ref> ''Foobar'' may have come about
        as a result of the pre-existing \\\"Foo\\\" being conjoined with \\\"bar\\\"
        an addition borrowed from the military's FUBAR. The use of ''foo'' in hacker
        and eventually in programming context may have begun in MIT's [[Tech Model
        Railroad Club]] (TMRC). In the complex model system, there were [[scram]]
        switches located at numerous places around the room that could be thrown if
        something undesirable was about to occur, such as a train going full-bore
        at an obstruction. Another feature of the system was a digital clock on the
        dispatch board. When someone hit a scram switch the clock stopped and the
        display was replaced with the word \\\"FOO\\\"; at TMRC the scram switches
        are therefore called \\\"Foo switches\\\". Because of this, an entry in the
        1959 Dictionary of the TMRC Language went something like this: \\\"FOO: The
        first syllable of the misquoted sacred chant phrase '[[Om mani padme hum|foo
        mane padme hum]].' Our first obligation is to keep the foo counters turning.\\\"<ref>{{cite
        web|url=http://www.computer-dictionary-online.org/?q=foo|title=Computer Dictionary
        Online}}, computer-dictionary-online.org</ref> One book{{which|date=November
        2010}} describing the MIT train room describes two buttons by the door: labelled
        foo and bar. These were general purpose buttons and were often re-purposed
        for whatever fun idea the MIT hackers had at the time, hence the adoption
        of foo and bar as general purpose variable names. An entry in the \\\"Abridged
        Dictionary of the TMRC Language\\\" states:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tmrc.mit.edu/dictionary.html|title=Abridged
        Dictionary of the TMRC Language|publisher=[[MIT]]}}</ref>\\n\\n{{Quote|text
        = Multiflush: stop-all-trains-button. Next best thing to the red door button.
        Also called FOO. Displays \\\"FOO\\\" on the clock when used.}}\\n\\nThe term
        ''foobar'' was propagated through computer science circles in the 1960s and
        early 1970s by system manuals from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]].{{citation
        needed|date=May 2009}} ''Foobar'' was also used as a variable name in the
        [[Fortran]] code of ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'' (1977 Crowther and Woods
        version). The variable FOOBAR was used to contain the player's progress in
        saying the magic phrase \\\"Fee Fie Foe Foo\\\".\\n\\nFoo's use in code is
        indeed as a place holder for an as yet unnamed object. The fact that it is
        often followed by Bar as another placeholder is due to the popularity of the
        1987 movie Lethal Weapon. In the movie the lead makes reference to FUBAR.
        Foo however is not the same as FU. Foo was originally from Foo Fighters and
        that a Foo is an unidentified object. Foo and Fubar have been conflated as
        the majority of people are unfamiliar with Foo Fighters.\\n\\n==Usage in code==\\nThe
        terms are very often used in programming examples, much like the [[Hello World]]
        program is commonly used as an introduction.  For example, ''foo'' and ''bar''
        might be used to illustrate a simple string concatenation:\\n\\n<syntaxhighlight
        lang=\\\"c\\\">\\n/* C code */\\n\\n#include <stdio.h>\\n\\nint main()\\n{\\n

        and [[command (computing)|command]]s whose purpose is unimportant and serve
        only to demonstrate a concept.  The words themselves have no meaning in this
        usage.  ''Foobar'' is sometimes used alone; ''foo'', ''bar'', and ''baz''
        are sometimes used, when multiple entities are needed.\\n\\nThe usage in [[computer
        programming]] examples and [[pseudocode]] varies; in certain circles, it is
        used extensively, but many prefer descriptive names, while others prefer to
        use single letters.  [[Eric S. Raymond]] has called it an \\\"important hackerism\\\"

        word]] from the 1930s, the military term [[FUBAR]] emerged in the 1940s, and
        the use of ''foo'' in a programming context is generally credited to the [[Tech
        Model Railroad Club]] (TMRC) of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]
        from circa 1960.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3092.txt|title=Etymology

        not known with certainty, and several anecdotal theories have been advanced
        to identify them.\\n\\nThe etymology of ''foo'' is explored in the [[Internet
        Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) RFC 3092, which gives the earliest documented
        use as being in the 1930s comic ''[[Smokey Stover]]'' by [[Bill Holman (cartoonist)|Bill
        Holman]], where it is used as a nonsense word.<ref name=\\\"jargon\\\">http://catb.org/jargon/html/F/foo.html
        foo</ref><ref>http://catb.org/jargon/html/index.html</ref> Holman states that
        he used the word due to having seen it on bottom of a jade Chinese figurine
        in [[Chinatown, San Francisco]], meaning \\\"good luck\\\".<ref>http://www.smokey-stover.com/history.html</ref><ref>[http://www.smokey-stover.com/
        smokey-stover.com]</ref><ref>http://members.aol.com/EOCostello/</ref> This
        is presumably as a transliteration of the [[fu character]] (f\\u00fa, \\u798f),
        which is a common character for fortune, and figurines of the trio of eponymous
        male \\\"star gods\\\" ''[[Fu Lu Shou|F\\u00fa, L\\u00f9, Sh\\u00f2u]]'' are
        common in Chinese communities; compare [[Fu Manchu]], fictional character
        popular in the 1930s. ''Smokey Stover'' ran 1935\\u201373, and continued to
        feature ''foo'' prominently, as on the front of the \\\"foomobile\\\" illustrated
        in the cover at right. The word ''foo'' became very popular in the 1930s,
        and also appeared in other cartoons including the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoons
        of [[Bob Clampett]] such as ''[[The Daffy Doc]]'' and ''[[Porky in Wackyland]]''
        (both 1938, with [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Porky Pig]]), and in other comic strips
        such as ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]''.\\n\\nFrom there, the Foo migrated into
        military slang, merged with \\\"FU\\\" of the [[FUBAR]].<ref name=\\\"rfc3092\\\">{{cite

        The term ''[[foo fighter]]'' was used by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]]
        aircraft pilots in [[World War II]] to describe various [[unidentified flying
        object|UFOs]] or mysterious aerial phenomena.\\n\\nThe first known use of
        the terms in print in a programming context appears in a 1965 edition of MIT's

        the address of location \\\"foobar\\\", than an effective word search for
        \\\"foobar\\\" would find location \\\"foo\\\" and the location containing
        the \\\"add\\\" instruction as well.}}</ref> ''Foobar'' may have come about
        as a result of the pre-existing \\\"Foo\\\" being conjoined with \\\"bar\\\"
        an addition borrowed from the military's FUBAR. The use of ''foo'' in hacker
        and eventually in programming context may have begun in MIT's [[Tech Model
        Railroad Club]] (TMRC). In the complex model system, there were [[scram]]
        switches located at numerous places around the room that could be thrown if
        something undesirable was about to occur, such as a train going full-bore
        at an obstruction. Another feature of the system was a digital clock on the
        dispatch board. When someone hit a scram switch the clock stopped and the
        display was replaced with the word \\\"FOO\\\"; at TMRC the scram switches
        are therefore called \\\"Foo switches\\\". Because of this, an entry in the
        1959 Dictionary of the TMRC Language went something like this: \\\"FOO: The
        first syllable of the misquoted sacred chant phrase '[[Om mani padme hum|foo
        mane padme hum]].' Our first obligation is to keep the foo counters turning.\\\"<ref>{{cite
        web|url=http://www.computer-dictionary-online.org/?q=foo|title=Computer Dictionary
        Online}}, computer-dictionary-online.org</ref> One book{{which|date=November
        2010}} describing the MIT train room describes two buttons by the door: labelled
        foo and bar. These were general purpose buttons and were often re-purposed
        for whatever fun idea the MIT hackers had at the time, hence the adoption
        of foo and bar as general purpose variable names. An entry in the \\\"Abridged
        Dictionary of the TMRC Language\\\" states:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tmrc.mit.edu/dictionary.html|title=Abridged
        Dictionary of the TMRC Language|publisher=[[MIT]]}}</ref>\\n\\n{{Quote|text
        = Multiflush: stop-all-trains-button. Next best thing to the red door button.
        Also called FOO. Displays \\\"FOO\\\" on the clock when used.}}\\n\\nThe term
        ''foobar'' was propagated through computer science circles in the 1960s and
        early 1970s by system manuals from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]].{{citation
        needed|date=May 2009}} ''Foobar'' was also used as a variable name in the
        [[Fortran]] code of ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'' (1977 Crowther and Woods
        version). The variable FOOBAR was used to contain the player's progress in
        saying the magic phrase \\\"Fee Fie Foe Foo\\\".\\n\\nFoo's use in code is
        indeed as a place holder for an as yet unnamed object. The fact that it is
        often followed by Bar as another placeholder is due to the popularity of the
        1987 movie Lethal Weapon. In the movie the lead makes reference to FUBAR.
        Foo however is not the same as FU. Foo was originally from Foo Fighters and
        that a Foo is an unidentified object. Foo and Fubar have been conflated as
        the majority of people are unfamiliar with Foo Fighters.\\n\\n==Usage in code==\\nThe
        terms are very often used in programming examples, much like the [[Hello World]]
        program is commonly used as an introduction.  For example, ''foo'' and ''bar''
        might be used to illustrate a simple string concatenation:\\n\\n<syntaxhighlight
        lang=\\\"c\\\">\\n/* C code */\\n\\n#include <stdio.h>\\n\\nint main()\\n{\\n
        \  char *foo = \\\"Hello\\\";\\n   char *bar = \\\"World!\\\";\\n   fprintf(stdout,
        \\\"%s %s\\\\n\\\", foo, bar);\\n\\n   return 0;\\n}\\n</syntaxhighlight>\\nAlso

        analogous way, although older synonyms may be used.  For example, \\\"''Some
        function foo'' will then be called\\\".  In these cases, ''foo'' and ''bar''
        are synonyms for ''whatever'' or ''whichever''. Or: \\\"A database record
        for user ''foo''\\\" is synonymous with: \\\"A database record for user ''whoever''\\\".\\n\\n==Usage

        not known with certainty, and several anecdotal theories have been advanced
        to identify them.\\n\\nThe etymology of ''foo'' is explored in the [[Internet
        Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) RFC 3092, which gives the earliest documented
        use as being in the 1930s comic ''[[Smokey Stover]]'' by [[Bill Holman (cartoonist)|Bill

        male \\\"star gods\\\" ''[[Fu Lu Shou|F\\u00fa, L\\u00f9, Sh\\u00f2u]]'' are
        common in Chinese communities; compare [[Fu Manchu]], fictional character
        popular in the 1930s. ''Smokey Stover'' ran 1935\\u201373, and continued to
        feature ''foo'' prominently, as on the front of the \\\"foomobile\\\" illustrated
        in the cover at right. The word ''foo'' became very popular in the 1930s,
        and also appeared in other cartoons including the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoons
        of [[Bob Clampett]] such as ''[[The Daffy Doc]]'' and ''[[Porky in Wackyland]]''
        (both 1938, with [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Porky Pig]]), and in other comic strips
        such as ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]''.\\n\\nFrom there, the Foo migrated into
        military slang, merged with \\\"FU\\\" of the [[FUBAR]].<ref name=\\\"rfc3092\\\">{{cite

        the address of location \\\"foobar\\\", than an effective word search for
        \\\"foobar\\\" would find location \\\"foo\\\" and the location containing
        the \\\"add\\\" instruction as well.}}</ref> ''Foobar'' may have come about
        as a result of the pre-existing \\\"Foo\\\" being conjoined with \\\"bar\\\"
        an addition borrowed from the military's FUBAR. The use of ''foo'' in hacker
        and eventually in programming context may have begun in MIT's [[Tech Model
        Railroad Club]] (TMRC). In the complex model system, there were [[scram]]
        switches located at numerous places around the room that could be thrown if
        something undesirable was about to occur, such as a train going full-bore
        at an obstruction. Another feature of the system was a digital clock on the
        dispatch board. When someone hit a scram switch the clock stopped and the
        display was replaced with the word \\\"FOO\\\"; at TMRC the scram switches
        are therefore called \\\"Foo switches\\\". Because of this, an entry in the
        1959 Dictionary of the TMRC Language went something like this: \\\"FOO: The
        first syllable of the misquoted sacred chant phrase '[[Om mani padme hum|foo
        mane padme hum]].' Our first obligation is to keep the foo counters turning.\\\"<ref>{{cite
        web|url=http://www.computer-dictionary-online.org/?q=foo|title=Computer Dictionary
        Online}}, computer-dictionary-online.org</ref> One book{{which|date=November
        2010}} describing the MIT train room describes two buttons by the door: labelled
        foo and bar. These were general purpose buttons and were often re-purposed
        for whatever fun idea the MIT hackers had at the time, hence the adoption
        of foo and bar as general purpose variable names. An entry in the \\\"Abridged
        Dictionary of the TMRC Language\\\" states:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tmrc.mit.edu/dictionary.html|title=Abridged
        Dictionary of the TMRC Language|publisher=[[MIT]]}}</ref>\\n\\n{{Quote|text
        = Multiflush: stop-all-trains-button. Next best thing to the red door button.
        Also called FOO. Displays \\\"FOO\\\" on the clock when used.}}\\n\\nThe term
        ''foobar'' was propagated through computer science circles in the 1960s and
        early 1970s by system manuals from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]].{{citation
        needed|date=May 2009}} ''Foobar'' was also used as a variable name in the
        [[Fortran]] code of ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'' (1977 Crowther and Woods
        version). The variable FOOBAR was used to contain the player's progress in
        saying the magic phrase \\\"Fee Fie Foe Foo\\\".\\n\\nFoo's use in code is
        indeed as a place holder for an as yet unnamed object. The fact that it is
        often followed by Bar as another placeholder is due to the popularity of the
        1987 movie Lethal Weapon. In the movie the lead makes reference to FUBAR.
        Foo however is not the same as FU. Foo was originally from Foo Fighters and
        that a Foo is an unidentified object. Foo and Fubar have been conflated as
        the majority of people are unfamiliar with Foo Fighters.\\n\\n==Usage in code==\\nThe
        terms are very often used in programming examples, much like the [[Hello World]]
        program is commonly used as an introduction.  For example, ''foo'' and ''bar''
        might be used to illustrate a simple string concatenation:\\n\\n<syntaxhighlight
        lang=\\\"c\\\">\\n/* C code */\\n\\n#include <stdio.h>\\n\\nint main()\\n{\\n
        \  char *foo = \\\"Hello\\\";\\n   char *bar = \\\"World!\\\";\\n   fprintf(stdout,
        \\\"%s %s\\\\n\\\", foo, bar);\\n\\n   return 0;\\n}\\n</syntaxhighlight>\\nAlso
        see  [[metasyntactic variables#Programming language examples|metasyntactic
        variables]].\\n\\n==Usage in speech==\\nThe terms are used in speech in an
        analogous way, although older synonyms may be used.  For example, \\\"''Some
        function foo'' will then be called\\\".  In these cases, ''foo'' and ''bar''
        are synonyms for ''whatever'' or ''whichever''. Or: \\\"A database record
        for user ''foo''\\\" is synonymous with: \\\"A database record for user ''whoever''\\\".\\n\\n==Usage
        in culture==\\n''$foo'' is the name of a [[Perl]] programming magazine,<ref>[http://foo-magazin.de/
        foo-magazin.de] {{de icon}}</ref> and [[Foo Camp]] is an annual [[hacker convention]].\\n\\nDuring
        the ''[[United States v. Microsoft Corp.]]'' trial, some evidence was presented
        that Microsoft had tried to use the [[Web Services Interoperability]] organization
        as a means to stifle competition, including e-mails in which top executives
        including [[Bill Gates]] referred to the WS-I using the codename \\\"foo\\\".<ref>[http://www.news.com/Microsoft-ploy-to-block-Sun-exposed/2100-1001_3-912906.html
        Microsoft ploy to block Sun exposed], news.com</ref>\\n\\nThese terms gave
        the name to [[foobar2000]], an audio player independently developed using
        C++, as its author was more focused on producing a functional program than
        on aesthetics.\\n\\nThere is a character named \\\"Master Foo\\\" in ''Rootless
