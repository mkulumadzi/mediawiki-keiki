        content was initially only in English, it quickly became [[multilingualism|multilingual]],
        through the launch of versions in different languages. All versions of Wikipedia
        are similar, but important differences exist in content and in editing practices.
        The [[English Wikipedia]] is now one of more than 200 Wikipedias, but remains
        the largest one, with {{srlink|Wikipedia:Size of Wikipedia|over {{#expr:0.1*floor
        ({{NUMBEROFARTICLES:R}}/100000)}} million}} articles. As of February 2014,

        tend to show that Wikipedia's accuracy is similar to Encyclopedia Britannica,
        with Wikipedia being much larger. However, critics have worried that [[Criticism
        of Wikipedia#Systemic bias in coverage|Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias]],
        and that its [[group dynamics]] hinder its goals. Most [[Academia|academics]],
        [[historian]]s, [[teacher]]s and [[journalist]]s reject Wikipedia as a reliable
        source of information for being a mixture of truths, half truths, and some
        falsehoods,<ref name=EdwinBlack/> and that as a resource about controversial
        topics, Wikipedia is notoriously subject to manipulation and spin.<ref name=Petrilli/>
        Wikipedia's [[WP:consensus|Consensus]] and [[WP:Undue|Undue Weight]] policies
        have been repeatedly criticised by prominent scholarly sources for undermining
        [[freedom of thought]] and leading to false beliefs based on incomplete information.<ref

        articles, and any Wikipedia article could be edited by any reader, even those
        who did not have a Wikipedia account. Modifications to all articles would
        immediately become available. As a result, all articles could contain inaccuracies,
        ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text until an editor would
        correct these issues.\\n\\n=== Restrictions ===\\nOver time, the English Wikipedia
        and some other Wikipedias gradually restricted modifications. For example,
        in the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered
        users may create a new article.<ref>{{srlink|Wikipedia:Tutorial/Registration|Registration
        notes}}</ref> On the English Wikipedia and some others, some particularly
        sensitive and/or vandalism-prone pages are now \\\"protected\\\" to some degree.<ref

        the [[German Wikipedia]] maintains \\\"stable versions\\\" of articles,<ref

        vandalism by removing information or entirely blanking a given page. Less
        common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but
        false information to an article, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals
        can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's
        title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an article, or
        use images disruptively.<ref name=\\\"WP vandalism manipulation 1\\\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Vandalism|Vandalism}}.

        Wikipedia was cited by ''The Economist'' as substantially in contrast to statistics
        for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). ''The Economist''
        reported that the number of contributors with an average of five of more edits
        per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages
        at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about
        2,000 editors up or down. The attrition rates for editors in English Wikipedia,
        by sharp comparison, were cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000
        editors which has dropped to 30,000 editors as of the start of 2014. At the
        quoted trend rate, the number of active editors in English Wikipedia has lost
        approximately 20,000 editors to attrition since 2007, and the documented trend
        rate indicates the loss of another 20,000 editors by 2021, down to 10,000
        active editors on English Wikipedia by 2021 if left unabated.<ref name=\\\"economist1\\\"
        /> Given that the trend analysis published in ''The Economist'' presents the
        number of active editors for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia)
        as remaining relatively constant and successful in sustaining its numbers
        at approximately 42,000 active editors, the contrast has pointed to the effectiveness
        of Wikipedia in other languages to retain its active editors on a renewable
        and sustained basis.<ref name=\\\"economist1\\\" /> No comment was made concerning
        which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other
        languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to
        English Wikipedia for effectively ameliorating substantial editor attrition

        said that both were essentially accurate and covered the major episodes in

        the article, he pointed out its \\\"waffling\\\" conclusion: \\\"Some historians

        a Wikipedia entry is 100 per cent factually correct, and those facts have

        His research examined the [[counterproductive work behavior]] of edit warring.
        Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \\\"undo\\\" operations were not
        the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and
        relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting \\\"reverting/reverted
        pairs\\\" or \\\"mutually reverting edit pairs.\\\" Such a \\\"mutually reverting
        edit pair\\\" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor
        who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the \\\"mutually
        reverting edit pairs.\\\" The results were tabulated for all language versions
        of Wikipedia, with the English Wikipedia three largest conflict rates applying
        to articles about (i) ''G.W. Bush'', (ii) ''Anarchism'' and (iii) ''Mohammad''.<ref

        largest conflict rates at the time of the Oxford study were for the articles

        MediaWiki is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] and it is used
        by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. Originally,
        Wikipedia ran on [[UseModWiki]] written in [[Perl]] by Clifford Adams (Phase
        I), which initially required [[CamelCase]] for article hyperlinks; the present
        double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase
        II), Wikipedia began running on a [[PhpWiki|PHP wiki]] engine with a MySQL
        database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by [[Magnus Manske]].
        The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the [[Exponential
        growth|exponentially increasing]] demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia
        shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by
        [[Lee Daniel Crocker]].\\n\\nSeveral MediaWiki extensions are installed<ref

        [[Porter five forces analysis]] framework for industry analysis, Wikipedia
        and its parent institution Wikimedia are known as \\\"first movers\\\" and
        \\\"radical innovators\\\" in the services provided and supported by an open-source,
        on-line encyclopedia.<ref name=\\\"Porter, M.E. 1985\\\">Porter, M.E. (1985)
        Competitive Advantage, Free Press, New York, 1985.</ref> The \\\"five forces\\\"
        are centered around the issue of \\\"competitive rivalry\\\" within the encyclopedia
        industry where Wikipedia is seen as having redefined by its \\\"radical innovation\\\"
        the parameters of effectiveness applied to conventional encyclopedia publication.
        This is the first force of Porter's five forces analysis.<ref name=\\\"Porter,
        M.E. 1980\\\">Porter, M.E. (1980) Competitive Strategy, Free Press, New York,
        1980.</ref> The second force is the \\\"threat of new entrants\\\" with competitive
        services and products possibly arising on the internet or the web. As a \\\"first
        mover\\\", Wikipedia has largely eluded the emergence of a [[fast second]]
        to challenge its radical innovation and its standing as the central provider
        of the services which it offers through the World Wide Web.<ref>Markides,
        Constantinos (2005). Fast Second, Wiley&Sons Inc., San Francisco, 2005</ref>
        Porter's third force is the \\\"threat of substitute products\\\" and it is
        too early to identify Google's \\\"Knowledge Graphs\\\" as an effective competitor
        given the current dependence of \\\"Knowledge Graphs\\\" upon Wikipedia's
        free access to its open-source services.<ref name=\\\"Porter, M.E. 1985\\\"
        /> The fourth force in the [[Porter five forces analysis]] is the \\\"bargaining
        power of consumers\\\" who use the services provided by Wikipedia, which has
        historically largely been nullified by the Wikipedia founding principle of
        an open invitation to expand and edit its content expressed in its moniker
        of being \\\"the encyclopedia which anyone can edit.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Porter,
        M.E. 1980\\\" /> The fifth force in the [[Porter five forces analysis]] is
        defined as the \\\"bargaining power of suppliers\\\", presently seen as the
        open domain of both the global internet as a whole and the resources of public
        libraries world-wide, and therefore it is not seen as a limiting factor in
        the immediate future of the further development of Wikipedia.<ref name=\\\"Porter,

        community news publications on English Wikipedia include the \\\"Wikiworld\\\"
        web comic, the [[WP:Wikipedia Weekly|''Wikipedia Weekly'']] podcast, and newsletters
        of specific WikiProjects like [[Wikipedia:BUGLE|''The Bugle'']] from [[WP:Milhist|WikiProject
        Military History]] and the monthly newsletter from [[WP:GOCE|The Guild of

        Wikimedia Blog] and ''[[:outreach:This Month in Education|This Month in Education]]''.\\n\\n==
        Access to content ==\\n\\n=== Content licensing ===\\nWhen the project was
        started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by [[GNU Free Documentation
        License]] (GFDL), a [[copyleft]] license permitting the redistribution, creation
        of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright
        of their work.<ref name=\\\"WP copyright and commerciality 1\\\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Copyrights}}</ref>
        GFDL was created for software manuals that come with [[free software]] programs
        licensed under [[GPL]]. This made it a poor choice for a general reference
        work; for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia
        to come with a full copy of the GFDL license text. In December 2002, the [[Creative
        Commons license]] was released: it was specifically designed for creative
        works in general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity
        among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia
        project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.<ref name=\\\"WPF switch

        update|year=2007|author=Walter Vermeir|publisher=Wikizine|accessdate=December
        4, 2007}}</ref> Because the two licenses, GFDL and Creative Commons, were
        incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the
        [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) released a new version of GFDL designed
        specifically to allow Wikipedia to {{srlink|Wikipedia:Licensing update|relicense
        its content to CC BY-SA}} by August 1, 2009. (A new version of GFDL automatically
        covers Wikipedia contents.) In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects
        held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.<ref

        across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia,
        include non-free image files under [[fair use]] doctrine, while the others
        have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their
        home countries (e.g. in [[Copyright law of Japan|Japanese copyright law]]).
        Media files covered by [[free content]] licenses (e.g. Creative Commons' CC
        BY-SA) are shared across language editions via [[Wikimedia Commons]] repository,
        a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia's accommodation
        of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe
        that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic
        text.<ref name=\\\"NYT photos on WP\\\">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/arts/20funny.html|title=Wikipedia

        The website [[DBpedia]], begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and
        category declarations of the English-language Wikipedia. Wikimedia has created
        the [[Wikidata]] project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts
        from each page of Wikipedia and the other WMF wikis and make it available
        in a queriable [[Semantic Web|semantic]] format, [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]].
        This is still under development. As of Feb 2014 it has 15,000,000 items and
        1,000 properties for describing them.\\n\\nObtaining the full contents of

        content has been accessible through the [[mobile web]] since July 2013, ''The

        reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, \\\"Only
        20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile
        devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic
        for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to
        mobile editing has lagged even more.\\\"<ref name=\\\"small screen\\\" />
        ''The New York Times'' reports that Mr. Moller of Wikimedia has assigned \\\"a

        Scientific use ===\\nIn [[computational linguistics]], [[information retrieval]]
        and [[natural language processing]], Wikipedia has seen widespread use as
        a [[text corpus|corpus]] for linguistic research. In particular, it commonly
        serves as a target knowledge base for the [[entity linking]] problem, which

        ==\\nA number of interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries
        written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first
        of these was the 1986 [[BBC Domesday Project]], which included text (entered
        on [[BBC Micro]] computers) and photographs from over 1&nbsp;million contributors
        in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was
        the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major
        multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of
        articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface
        and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website
        until 2008.<ref name=\\\"Domesday Project\\\" />\\n\\nOne of the most successful
        early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was [[h2g2]],
        which was created by [[Douglas Adams]]. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively
        light-hearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.
        [[Everything2]] was created in 1998. All of these projects had similarities
        with Wikipedia, but were not wikis and neither gave full editorial privileges
        to public users.\\n\\n[[GNE (encyclopedia)|GNE]], an encyclopedia which was
        not a wiki, also created in January 2001, co-existed with Nupedia and Wikipedia
        early in its history; however, it has been retired.<ref name=\\\"stallman1999\\\"
        />\\n\\nOther websites centered on collaborative [[knowledge base]] development
        have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as [[Susning.nu]], [[Enciclopedia
        Libre Universal en Espa\\u00f1ol|Enciclopedia Libre]], [[Hudong]], and [[Baidu
        Baike]] likewise employ no formal review process, although some like [[Conservapedia]]
        are not as open. Others use more traditional [[peer review]], such as [[Encyclopedia
        of Life]] and the online wiki encyclopedias [[Scholarpedia]] and [[Citizendium]].
        The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative
        to Wikipedia.<ref name=\\\"Orlowski18\\\" /><ref name=\\\"JayLyman\\\" />\\n\\n==

        through the launch of versions in different languages. All versions of Wikipedia
        are similar, but important differences exist in content and in editing practices.
        The [[English Wikipedia]] is now one of more than 200 Wikipedias, but remains
        the largest one, with {{srlink|Wikipedia:Size of Wikipedia|over {{#expr:0.1*floor
        ({{NUMBEROFARTICLES:R}}/100000)}} million}} articles. As of February 2014,

        tend to show that Wikipedia's accuracy is similar to Encyclopedia Britannica,
        with Wikipedia being much larger. However, critics have worried that [[Criticism
        of Wikipedia#Systemic bias in coverage|Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias]],
        and that its [[group dynamics]] hinder its goals. Most [[Academia|academics]],
        [[historian]]s, [[teacher]]s and [[journalist]]s reject Wikipedia as a reliable
        source of information for being a mixture of truths, half truths, and some
        falsehoods,<ref name=EdwinBlack/> and that as a resource about controversial
        topics, Wikipedia is notoriously subject to manipulation and spin.<ref name=Petrilli/>
        Wikipedia's [[WP:consensus|Consensus]] and [[WP:Undue|Undue Weight]] policies
        have been repeatedly criticised by prominent scholarly sources for undermining
        [[freedom of thought]] and leading to false beliefs based on incomplete information.<ref

        articles, and any Wikipedia article could be edited by any reader, even those
        who did not have a Wikipedia account. Modifications to all articles would
        immediately become available. As a result, all articles could contain inaccuracies,
        ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text until an editor would
        correct these issues.\\n\\n=== Restrictions ===\\nOver time, the English Wikipedia
        and some other Wikipedias gradually restricted modifications. For example,
        in the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered
        users may create a new article.<ref>{{srlink|Wikipedia:Tutorial/Registration|Registration
        notes}}</ref> On the English Wikipedia and some others, some particularly
        sensitive and/or vandalism-prone pages are now \\\"protected\\\" to some degree.<ref

        to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors. For example,
        the [[German Wikipedia]] maintains \\\"stable versions\\\" of articles,<ref
        name=\\\"WP some sites stable versions 1\\\">{{cite mailing list|first=P.|last=Birken|url=http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikide-l/2008-December/021594.html|title=Bericht

        of changes===\\nAlthough changes are not systematically reviewed, the software
        that powers Wikipedia provides certain tools allowing anyone to review changes
        made by others. The \\\"History\\\" page of each article links to each revision.<ref

        infringements [[WP:Suppression|may be removed completely]].</ref><ref name=\\\"Torsten_Kleinz\\\"

        the article's history page. Anyone can view the [[Help:Recent changes|latest
        changes]] to articles, and anyone may maintain a [[Recent changes|\\\"watchlist\\\"]]
        of articles that interest them so they can be notified of any changes. \\\"New

        obvious problems.<ref>[[Wikipedia:New pages patrol]]</ref>\\n\\nIn 2003, economics
        PhD student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low [[transaction cost]]s of
        participating in a [[wiki]] create a catalyst for collaborative development,
        and that features such as easy access to past versions of a page favor \\\"creative

        vandalism by removing information or entirely blanking a given page. Less
        common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but

        can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's

        to Eric Goldman, is found in editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural
        rituals, such as signing talk pages, implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia
        outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount
        their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs:
        the contributor is expected to build a user page, learn Wikipedia-specific
        technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process,
        and learn a \\\"baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references\\\".

        Wikipedia was cited by ''The Economist'' as substantially in contrast to statistics
        for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). ''The Economist''
        reported that the number of contributors with an average of five of more edits
        per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages
        at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about
        2,000 editors up or down. The attrition rates for editors in English Wikipedia,
        by sharp comparison, were cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000
        editors which has dropped to 30,000 editors as of the start of 2014. At the
        quoted trend rate, the number of active editors in English Wikipedia has lost
        approximately 20,000 editors to attrition since 2007, and the documented trend
        rate indicates the loss of another 20,000 editors by 2021, down to 10,000
        active editors on English Wikipedia by 2021 if left unabated.<ref name=\\\"economist1\\\"
        /> Given that the trend analysis published in ''The Economist'' presents the
        number of active editors for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia)
        as remaining relatively constant and successful in sustaining its numbers
        at approximately 42,000 active editors, the contrast has pointed to the effectiveness
        of Wikipedia in other languages to retain its active editors on a renewable
        and sustained basis.<ref name=\\\"economist1\\\" /> No comment was made concerning
        which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other

        His research examined the [[counterproductive work behavior]] of edit warring.
        Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \\\"undo\\\" operations were not
        the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and
        relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting \\\"reverting/reverted
        pairs\\\" or \\\"mutually reverting edit pairs.\\\" Such a \\\"mutually reverting
        edit pair\\\" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor
        who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the \\\"mutually
        reverting edit pairs.\\\" The results were tabulated for all language versions
        of Wikipedia, with the English Wikipedia three largest conflict rates applying
        to articles about (i) ''G.W. Bush'', (ii) ''Anarchism'' and (iii) ''Mohammad''.<ref

        largest conflict rates at the time of the Oxford study were for the articles

        upon the [[MySQL]] database system.<ref name=\\\"nedworks database system\\\">{{cite

        a [[transclusion]] system for [[Web template|templates]], and [[URL redirection]].
        MediaWiki is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] and it is used
        by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. Originally,
        Wikipedia ran on [[UseModWiki]] written in [[Perl]] by Clifford Adams (Phase
        I), which initially required [[CamelCase]] for article hyperlinks; the present
        double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase
        II), Wikipedia began running on a [[PhpWiki|PHP wiki]] engine with a MySQL
        database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by [[Magnus Manske]].
        The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the [[Exponential
        growth|exponentially increasing]] demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia
        shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by
        [[Lee Daniel Crocker]].\\n\\nSeveral MediaWiki extensions are installed<ref

        [[Porter five forces analysis]] framework for industry analysis, Wikipedia
        and its parent institution Wikimedia are known as \\\"first movers\\\" and
        \\\"radical innovators\\\" in the services provided and supported by an open-source,
        on-line encyclopedia.<ref name=\\\"Porter, M.E. 1985\\\">Porter, M.E. (1985)
        Competitive Advantage, Free Press, New York, 1985.</ref> The \\\"five forces\\\"
        are centered around the issue of \\\"competitive rivalry\\\" within the encyclopedia
        industry where Wikipedia is seen as having redefined by its \\\"radical innovation\\\"
        the parameters of effectiveness applied to conventional encyclopedia publication.
        This is the first force of Porter's five forces analysis.<ref name=\\\"Porter,
        M.E. 1980\\\">Porter, M.E. (1980) Competitive Strategy, Free Press, New York,
        1980.</ref> The second force is the \\\"threat of new entrants\\\" with competitive
        services and products possibly arising on the internet or the web. As a \\\"first
        mover\\\", Wikipedia has largely eluded the emergence of a [[fast second]]
        to challenge its radical innovation and its standing as the central provider
        of the services which it offers through the World Wide Web.<ref>Markides,
        Constantinos (2005). Fast Second, Wiley&Sons Inc., San Francisco, 2005</ref>
        Porter's third force is the \\\"threat of substitute products\\\" and it is
        too early to identify Google's \\\"Knowledge Graphs\\\" as an effective competitor
        given the current dependence of \\\"Knowledge Graphs\\\" upon Wikipedia's
        free access to its open-source services.<ref name=\\\"Porter, M.E. 1985\\\"
        /> The fourth force in the [[Porter five forces analysis]] is the \\\"bargaining
        power of consumers\\\" who use the services provided by Wikipedia, which has
        historically largely been nullified by the Wikipedia founding principle of
        an open invitation to expand and edit its content expressed in its moniker
        of being \\\"the encyclopedia which anyone can edit.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Porter,
        M.E. 1980\\\" /> The fifth force in the [[Porter five forces analysis]] is
        defined as the \\\"bargaining power of suppliers\\\", presently seen as the
        open domain of both the global internet as a whole and the resources of public
        libraries world-wide, and therefore it is not seen as a limiting factor in
        the immediate future of the further development of Wikipedia.<ref name=\\\"Porter,

        da Wikip\\u00e9dia|''Correro da Wikip\\u00e9dia'']]. Other past and present
        community news publications on English Wikipedia include the \\\"Wikiworld\\\"
        web comic, the [[WP:Wikipedia Weekly|''Wikipedia Weekly'']] podcast, and newsletters
        of specific WikiProjects like [[Wikipedia:BUGLE|''The Bugle'']] from [[WP:Milhist|WikiProject
        Military History]] and the monthly newsletter from [[WP:GOCE|The Guild of
        Copy Editors]]. There are also a number of publications from the Wikimedia

        Wikimedia Blog] and ''[[:outreach:This Month in Education|This Month in Education]]''.\\n\\n==
        Access to content ==\\n\\n=== Content licensing ===\\nWhen the project was
        started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by [[GNU Free Documentation
        License]] (GFDL), a [[copyleft]] license permitting the redistribution, creation
        of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright
        of their work.<ref name=\\\"WP copyright and commerciality 1\\\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Copyrights}}</ref>
        GFDL was created for software manuals that come with [[free software]] programs
        licensed under [[GPL]]. This made it a poor choice for a general reference
        work; for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia
        to come with a full copy of the GFDL license text. In December 2002, the [[Creative
        Commons license]] was released: it was specifically designed for creative
        works in general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity
        among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia
        project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.<ref name=\\\"WPF switch
        to CC\\\">{{cite web|url=http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:License_update|title=Resolution:License
        update|year=2007|author=Walter Vermeir|publisher=Wikizine|accessdate=December
        4, 2007}}</ref> Because the two licenses, GFDL and Creative Commons, were
        incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the
        [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) released a new version of GFDL designed
        specifically to allow Wikipedia to {{srlink|Wikipedia:Licensing update|relicense
        its content to CC BY-SA}} by August 1, 2009. (A new version of GFDL automatically
        covers Wikipedia contents.) In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects
        held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.<ref

        across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia,
        include non-free image files under [[fair use]] doctrine, while the others
        have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their
        home countries (e.g. in [[Copyright law of Japan|Japanese copyright law]]).
        Media files covered by [[free content]] licenses (e.g. Creative Commons' CC
        BY-SA) are shared across language editions via [[Wikimedia Commons]] repository,
        a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia's accommodation
        of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe
        that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic
        text.<ref name=\\\"NYT photos on WP\\\">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/arts/20funny.html|title=Wikipedia

        The website [[DBpedia]], begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and
        category declarations of the English-language Wikipedia. Wikimedia has created
        the [[Wikidata]] project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts
        from each page of Wikipedia and the other WMF wikis and make it available
        in a queriable [[Semantic Web|semantic]] format, [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]].
        This is still under development. As of Feb 2014 it has 15,000,000 items and
        1,000 properties for describing them.\\n\\nObtaining the full contents of

        content has been accessible through the [[mobile web]] since July 2013, ''The
        New York Times'' on 9 February 2014 quoted Erik Moller, deputy director of
        the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic
        from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and
        worry.<ref name=\\\"small screen\\\" /> The ''The New York Times'' article
        reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, \\\"Only
        20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile
        devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic
        for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to
        mobile editing has lagged even more.\\\"<ref name=\\\"small screen\\\" />
        ''The New York Times'' reports that Mr. Moller of Wikimedia has assigned \\\"a

        200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited
        by ''The New York Times'' for the \\\"worry\\\" is for Wikipedia to effectively

        2014, ''The New York Times'' reported that Wikipedia is ranked fifth globally
        among all websites, stating \\\"With 18 billion page views and nearly 500

        has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception
        in 2001.<ref name=\\\"comscore\\\" /> About 50% of search engine traffic to
        Wikipedia comes from Google,<ref name=\\\"hitwisegoogle\\\" /> a good portion
        of which is related to academic research.<ref name=\\\"hitwiseAcademic\\\"
        /> The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365 million at the
        end of 2009.<ref name=\\\"365M\\\" /> The [[Pew Research Center|Pew]] Internet
        and American Life project found that one third of US Internet users consulted
        Wikipedia.<ref name=\\\"Wikipedia users\\\" /> In 2011 ''Business Insider''

        than five times a month, and a similar number of readers specifically look

        for possibly leading to professional (and, in his view, superior) content
        producers going out of business, because \\\"free trumps quality all the time\\\".
        Carr wrote: \\\"Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the hegemony

        Scientific use ===\\nIn [[computational linguistics]], [[information retrieval]]
        and [[natural language processing]], Wikipedia has seen widespread use as
        a [[text corpus|corpus]] for linguistic research. In particular, it commonly
        serves as a target knowledge base for the [[entity linking]] problem, which
        is then called \\\"wikification\\\",<ref name=\\\"wikify\\\">Rada Mihalcea

        ==\\nA number of interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries
        written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first
        of these was the 1986 [[BBC Domesday Project]], which included text (entered
        on [[BBC Micro]] computers) and photographs from over 1&nbsp;million contributors
        in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was
        the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major
        multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of
        articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface
        and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website
        until 2008.<ref name=\\\"Domesday Project\\\" />\\n\\nOne of the most successful
        early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was [[h2g2]],
        which was created by [[Douglas Adams]]. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively
        light-hearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.
        [[Everything2]] was created in 1998. All of these projects had similarities
        with Wikipedia, but were not wikis and neither gave full editorial privileges
        to public users.\\n\\n[[GNE (encyclopedia)|GNE]], an encyclopedia which was
        not a wiki, also created in January 2001, co-existed with Nupedia and Wikipedia
        early in its history; however, it has been retired.<ref name=\\\"stallman1999\\\"
        />\\n\\nOther websites centered on collaborative [[knowledge base]] development
        have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as [[Susning.nu]], [[Enciclopedia
        Libre Universal en Espa\\u00f1ol|Enciclopedia Libre]], [[Hudong]], and [[Baidu
        Baike]] likewise employ no formal review process, although some like [[Conservapedia]]
        are not as open. Others use more traditional [[peer review]], such as [[Encyclopedia
        of Life]] and the online wiki encyclopedias [[Scholarpedia]] and [[Citizendium]].
        The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative
        to Wikipedia.<ref name=\\\"Orlowski18\\\" /><ref name=\\\"JayLyman\\\" />\\n\\n==

        The [[English Wikipedia]] is now one of more than 200 Wikipedias, but remains
        the largest one, with {{srlink|Wikipedia:Size of Wikipedia|over {{#expr:0.1*floor

        tend to show that Wikipedia's accuracy is similar to Encyclopedia Britannica,
        with Wikipedia being much larger. However, critics have worried that [[Criticism
        of Wikipedia#Systemic bias in coverage|Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias]],
        and that its [[group dynamics]] hinder its goals. Most [[Academia|academics]],
        [[historian]]s, [[teacher]]s and [[journalist]]s reject Wikipedia as a reliable
        source of information for being a mixture of truths, half truths, and some
        falsehoods,<ref name=EdwinBlack/> and that as a resource about controversial
        topics, Wikipedia is notoriously subject to manipulation and spin.<ref name=Petrilli/>
        Wikipedia's [[WP:consensus|Consensus]] and [[WP:Undue|Undue Weight]] policies
        have been repeatedly criticised by prominent scholarly sources for undermining

        articles, and any Wikipedia article could be edited by any reader, even those
        who did not have a Wikipedia account. Modifications to all articles would
        immediately become available. As a result, all articles could contain inaccuracies,
        ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text until an editor would
        correct these issues.\\n\\n=== Restrictions ===\\nOver time, the English Wikipedia
        and some other Wikipedias gradually restricted modifications. For example,
        in the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered
        users may create a new article.<ref>{{srlink|Wikipedia:Tutorial/Registration|Registration
        notes}}</ref> On the English Wikipedia and some others, some particularly

        to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors. For example,
        the [[German Wikipedia]] maintains \\\"stable versions\\\" of articles,<ref

        that powers Wikipedia provides certain tools allowing anyone to review changes
        made by others. The \\\"History\\\" page of each article links to each revision.<ref

        infringements [[WP:Suppression|may be removed completely]].</ref><ref name=\\\"Torsten_Kleinz\\\"

        the article's history page. Anyone can view the [[Help:Recent changes|latest
        changes]] to articles, and anyone may maintain a [[Recent changes|\\\"watchlist\\\"]]

        PhD student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low [[transaction cost]]s of

        Wikipedia}}\\n\\nAny edit that changes content in a way that deliberately
        compromises the integrity of Wikipedia is considered vandalism. The most common
        and obvious types of vandalism include insertion of obscenities and crude
        humor. Vandalism can also include advertising language and other types of
        [[Wikipedia:Spam|spam]].<ref name=\\\"upenn link spamming 1\\\">[http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1508&context=cis_papers

        vandalism by removing information or entirely blanking a given page. Less
        common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but
        false information to an article, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals
        can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's
        title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an article, or
        use images disruptively.<ref name=\\\"WP vandalism manipulation 1\\\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Vandalism|Vandalism}}.

        [\\u2026] which explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as
        a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise.
        As a community, far from being elitist, it is anti-elitist (which, in this
        context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs
        and disrespect of expertise is tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy
        that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did

        Wikipedia was cited by ''The Economist'' as substantially in contrast to statistics
        for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). ''The Economist''
        reported that the number of contributors with an average of five of more edits
        per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages
        at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about
        2,000 editors up or down. The attrition rates for editors in English Wikipedia,
        by sharp comparison, were cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000
        editors which has dropped to 30,000 editors as of the start of 2014. At the
        quoted trend rate, the number of active editors in English Wikipedia has lost
        approximately 20,000 editors to attrition since 2007, and the documented trend
        rate indicates the loss of another 20,000 editors by 2021, down to 10,000
        active editors on English Wikipedia by 2021 if left unabated.<ref name=\\\"economist1\\\"
        /> Given that the trend analysis published in ''The Economist'' presents the
        number of active editors for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia)
        as remaining relatively constant and successful in sustaining its numbers
        at approximately 42,000 active editors, the contrast has pointed to the effectiveness
        of Wikipedia in other languages to retain its active editors on a renewable
        and sustained basis.<ref name=\\\"economist1\\\" /> No comment was made concerning
        which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other

        His research examined the [[counterproductive work behavior]] of edit warring.
        Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \\\"undo\\\" operations were not
        the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and
        relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting \\\"reverting/reverted
        pairs\\\" or \\\"mutually reverting edit pairs.\\\" Such a \\\"mutually reverting
        edit pair\\\" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor
        who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the \\\"mutually
        reverting edit pairs.\\\" The results were tabulated for all language versions
        of Wikipedia, with the English Wikipedia three largest conflict rates applying
        to articles about (i) ''G.W. Bush'', (ii) ''Anarchism'' and (iii) ''Mohammad''.<ref

        largest conflict rates at the time of the Oxford study were for the articles

        a [[transclusion]] system for [[Web template|templates]], and [[URL redirection]].
        MediaWiki is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] and it is used
        by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. Originally,
        Wikipedia ran on [[UseModWiki]] written in [[Perl]] by Clifford Adams (Phase
        I), which initially required [[CamelCase]] for article hyperlinks; the present
        double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase
        II), Wikipedia began running on a [[PhpWiki|PHP wiki]] engine with a MySQL
        database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by [[Magnus Manske]].
        The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the [[Exponential
        growth|exponentially increasing]] demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia
        shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by
        [[Lee Daniel Crocker]].\\n\\nSeveral MediaWiki extensions are installed<ref

        [[Porter five forces analysis]] framework for industry analysis, Wikipedia
        and its parent institution Wikimedia are known as \\\"first movers\\\" and
        \\\"radical innovators\\\" in the services provided and supported by an open-source,
        on-line encyclopedia.<ref name=\\\"Porter, M.E. 1985\\\">Porter, M.E. (1985)
        Competitive Advantage, Free Press, New York, 1985.</ref> The \\\"five forces\\\"
        are centered around the issue of \\\"competitive rivalry\\\" within the encyclopedia
        industry where Wikipedia is seen as having redefined by its \\\"radical innovation\\\"
        the parameters of effectiveness applied to conventional encyclopedia publication.
        This is the first force of Porter's five forces analysis.<ref name=\\\"Porter,
        M.E. 1980\\\">Porter, M.E. (1980) Competitive Strategy, Free Press, New York,
        1980.</ref> The second force is the \\\"threat of new entrants\\\" with competitive
        services and products possibly arising on the internet or the web. As a \\\"first
        mover\\\", Wikipedia has largely eluded the emergence of a [[fast second]]
        to challenge its radical innovation and its standing as the central provider
        of the services which it offers through the World Wide Web.<ref>Markides,
        Constantinos (2005). Fast Second, Wiley&Sons Inc., San Francisco, 2005</ref>
        Porter's third force is the \\\"threat of substitute products\\\" and it is
        too early to identify Google's \\\"Knowledge Graphs\\\" as an effective competitor
        given the current dependence of \\\"Knowledge Graphs\\\" upon Wikipedia's
        free access to its open-source services.<ref name=\\\"Porter, M.E. 1985\\\"
        /> The fourth force in the [[Porter five forces analysis]] is the \\\"bargaining
        power of consumers\\\" who use the services provided by Wikipedia, which has
        historically largely been nullified by the Wikipedia founding principle of
        an open invitation to expand and edit its content expressed in its moniker
        of being \\\"the encyclopedia which anyone can edit.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Porter,
        M.E. 1980\\\" /> The fifth force in the [[Porter five forces analysis]] is
        defined as the \\\"bargaining power of suppliers\\\", presently seen as the
        open domain of both the global internet as a whole and the resources of public
        libraries world-wide, and therefore it is not seen as a limiting factor in
        the immediate future of the further development of Wikipedia.<ref name=\\\"Porter,

        of specific WikiProjects like [[Wikipedia:BUGLE|''The Bugle'']] from [[WP:Milhist|WikiProject
        Military History]] and the monthly newsletter from [[WP:GOCE|The Guild of

        Access to content ==\\n\\n=== Content licensing ===\\nWhen the project was
        started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by [[GNU Free Documentation
        License]] (GFDL), a [[copyleft]] license permitting the redistribution, creation
        of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright
        of their work.<ref name=\\\"WP copyright and commerciality 1\\\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Copyrights}}</ref>
        GFDL was created for software manuals that come with [[free software]] programs
        licensed under [[GPL]]. This made it a poor choice for a general reference
        work; for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia
        to come with a full copy of the GFDL license text. In December 2002, the [[Creative
        Commons license]] was released: it was specifically designed for creative
        works in general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity
        among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia
        project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.<ref name=\\\"WPF switch

        4, 2007}}</ref> Because the two licenses, GFDL and Creative Commons, were
        incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the
        [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) released a new version of GFDL designed
        specifically to allow Wikipedia to {{srlink|Wikipedia:Licensing update|relicense
        its content to CC BY-SA}} by August 1, 2009. (A new version of GFDL automatically
        covers Wikipedia contents.) In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects
        held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.<ref

        across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia,
        include non-free image files under [[fair use]] doctrine, while the others
        have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their
        home countries (e.g. in [[Copyright law of Japan|Japanese copyright law]]).
        Media files covered by [[free content]] licenses (e.g. Creative Commons' CC
        BY-SA) are shared across language editions via [[Wikimedia Commons]] repository,
        a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia's accommodation
        of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe
        that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic

        The website [[DBpedia]], begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and

        the [[Wikidata]] project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts
        from each page of Wikipedia and the other WMF wikis and make it available
        in a queriable [[Semantic Web|semantic]] format, [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]].
        This is still under development. As of Feb 2014 it has 15,000,000 items and
        1,000 properties for describing them.\\n\\nObtaining the full contents of

        worry.<ref name=\\\"small screen\\\" /> The ''The New York Times'' article
        reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, \\\"Only
        20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile
        devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic
        for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to

        Scientific use ===\\nIn [[computational linguistics]], [[information retrieval]]
        and [[natural language processing]], Wikipedia has seen widespread use as
        a [[text corpus|corpus]] for linguistic research. In particular, it commonly
        serves as a target knowledge base for the [[entity linking]] problem, which
        is then called \\\"wikification\\\",<ref name=\\\"wikify\\\">Rada Mihalcea

        ==\\nA number of interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries
        written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first
        of these was the 1986 [[BBC Domesday Project]], which included text (entered
        on [[BBC Micro]] computers) and photographs from over 1&nbsp;million contributors
        in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was
        the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major
        multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of
        articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface
        and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website
        until 2008.<ref name=\\\"Domesday Project\\\" />\\n\\nOne of the most successful
        early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was [[h2g2]],
        which was created by [[Douglas Adams]]. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively
        light-hearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.
        [[Everything2]] was created in 1998. All of these projects had similarities
        with Wikipedia, but were not wikis and neither gave full editorial privileges
        to public users.\\n\\n[[GNE (encyclopedia)|GNE]], an encyclopedia which was
        not a wiki, also created in January 2001, co-existed with Nupedia and Wikipedia
        early in its history; however, it has been retired.<ref name=\\\"stallman1999\\\"
        />\\n\\nOther websites centered on collaborative [[knowledge base]] development
        have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as [[Susning.nu]], [[Enciclopedia
        Libre Universal en Espa\\u00f1ol|Enciclopedia Libre]], [[Hudong]], and [[Baidu
        Baike]] likewise employ no formal review process, although some like [[Conservapedia]]
        are not as open. Others use more traditional [[peer review]], such as [[Encyclopedia
        of Life]] and the online wiki encyclopedias [[Scholarpedia]] and [[Citizendium]].
        The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative
        to Wikipedia.<ref name=\\\"Orlowski18\\\" /><ref name=\\\"JayLyman\\\" />\\n\\n==

        (long question period), somewhat outdated, and only an elite audience will
        understand all topics (certainly not a first-time reader of this article).
        Some topics: Visual editor (outdated), code review, wiki engines, MediaWiki's
        database model, MediaWiki's suitability for Wikimedia sites, AFD process,
        flagged revisions and proposed more advanced revision selection mechanisms,

        through the launch of versions in different languages. All versions of Wikipedia
        are similar, but important differences exist in content and in editing practices.
        The [[English Wikipedia]] is now one of more than 200 Wikipedias, but remains
        the largest one, with {{srlink|Wikipedia:Size of Wikipedia|over {{#expr:0.1*floor

        tend to show that Wikipedia's accuracy is similar to Encyclopedia Britannica,
        with Wikipedia being much larger. However, critics have worried that [[Criticism
        of Wikipedia#Systemic bias in coverage|Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias]],
        and that its [[group dynamics]] hinder its goals. Most [[Academia|academics]],
        [[historian]]s, [[teacher]]s and [[journalist]]s reject Wikipedia as a reliable
        source of information for being a mixture of truths, half truths, and some
        falsehoods,<ref name=EdwinBlack/> and that as a resource about controversial
        topics, Wikipedia is notoriously subject to manipulation and spin.<ref name=Petrilli/>
        Wikipedia's [[WP:consensus|Consensus]] and [[WP:Undue|Undue Weight]] policies
        have been repeatedly criticised by prominent scholarly sources for undermining

        articles, and any Wikipedia article could be edited by any reader, even those
        who did not have a Wikipedia account. Modifications to all articles would
        immediately become available. As a result, all articles could contain inaccuracies,
        ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text until an editor would
        correct these issues.\\n\\n=== Restrictions ===\\nOver time, the English Wikipedia
        and some other Wikipedias gradually restricted modifications. For example,
        in the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered
        users may create a new article.<ref>{{srlink|Wikipedia:Tutorial/Registration|Registration
        notes}}</ref> On the English Wikipedia and some others, some particularly

        the [[German Wikipedia]] maintains \\\"stable versions\\\" of articles,<ref

        Wikipedia}}\\n\\nAny edit that changes content in a way that deliberately
        compromises the integrity of Wikipedia is considered vandalism. The most common
        and obvious types of vandalism include insertion of obscenities and crude
        humor. Vandalism can also include advertising language and other types of
        [[Wikipedia:Spam|spam]].<ref name=\\\"upenn link spamming 1\\\">[http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1508&context=cis_papers

        vandalism by removing information or entirely blanking a given page. Less
        common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but
        false information to an article, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals
        can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's
        title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an article, or
        use images disruptively.<ref name=\\\"WP vandalism manipulation 1\\\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Vandalism|Vandalism}}.

        and disrespect of expertise is tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy
        that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did

        Wikipedia was cited by ''The Economist'' as substantially in contrast to statistics
        for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). ''The Economist''
        reported that the number of contributors with an average of five of more edits
        per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages
        at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about
        2,000 editors up or down. The attrition rates for editors in English Wikipedia,
        by sharp comparison, were cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000
        editors which has dropped to 30,000 editors as of the start of 2014. At the
        quoted trend rate, the number of active editors in English Wikipedia has lost
        approximately 20,000 editors to attrition since 2007, and the documented trend
        rate indicates the loss of another 20,000 editors by 2021, down to 10,000
        active editors on English Wikipedia by 2021 if left unabated.<ref name=\\\"economist1\\\"
        /> Given that the trend analysis published in ''The Economist'' presents the
        number of active editors for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia)
        as remaining relatively constant and successful in sustaining its numbers
        at approximately 42,000 active editors, the contrast has pointed to the effectiveness
        of Wikipedia in other languages to retain its active editors on a renewable
        and sustained basis.<ref name=\\\"economist1\\\" /> No comment was made concerning
        which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other
        languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to

        His research examined the [[counterproductive work behavior]] of edit warring.
        Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \\\"undo\\\" operations were not
        the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and
        relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting \\\"reverting/reverted
        pairs\\\" or \\\"mutually reverting edit pairs.\\\" Such a \\\"mutually reverting
        edit pair\\\" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor
        who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the \\\"mutually
        reverting edit pairs.\\\" The results were tabulated for all language versions
        of Wikipedia, with the English Wikipedia three largest conflict rates applying
        to articles about (i) ''G.W. Bush'', (ii) ''Anarchism'' and (iii) ''Mohammad''.<ref

        largest conflict rates at the time of the Oxford study were for the articles

        MediaWiki is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] and it is used
        by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. Originally,
        Wikipedia ran on [[UseModWiki]] written in [[Perl]] by Clifford Adams (Phase
        I), which initially required [[CamelCase]] for article hyperlinks; the present
        double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase
        II), Wikipedia began running on a [[PhpWiki|PHP wiki]] engine with a MySQL
        database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by [[Magnus Manske]].
        The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the [[Exponential
        growth|exponentially increasing]] demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia
        shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by
        [[Lee Daniel Crocker]].\\n\\nSeveral MediaWiki extensions are installed<ref

        industry where Wikipedia is seen as having redefined by its \\\"radical innovation\\\"
        the parameters of effectiveness applied to conventional encyclopedia publication.
        This is the first force of Porter's five forces analysis.<ref name=\\\"Porter,
        M.E. 1980\\\">Porter, M.E. (1980) Competitive Strategy, Free Press, New York,
        1980.</ref> The second force is the \\\"threat of new entrants\\\" with competitive
        services and products possibly arising on the internet or the web. As a \\\"first
        mover\\\", Wikipedia has largely eluded the emergence of a [[fast second]]
        to challenge its radical innovation and its standing as the central provider
        of the services which it offers through the World Wide Web.<ref>Markides,
        Constantinos (2005). Fast Second, Wiley&Sons Inc., San Francisco, 2005</ref>
        Porter's third force is the \\\"threat of substitute products\\\" and it is
        too early to identify Google's \\\"Knowledge Graphs\\\" as an effective competitor
        given the current dependence of \\\"Knowledge Graphs\\\" upon Wikipedia's
        free access to its open-source services.<ref name=\\\"Porter, M.E. 1985\\\"
        /> The fourth force in the [[Porter five forces analysis]] is the \\\"bargaining
        power of consumers\\\" who use the services provided by Wikipedia, which has
        historically largely been nullified by the Wikipedia founding principle of
        an open invitation to expand and edit its content expressed in its moniker
        of being \\\"the encyclopedia which anyone can edit.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Porter,
        M.E. 1980\\\" /> The fifth force in the [[Porter five forces analysis]] is
        defined as the \\\"bargaining power of suppliers\\\", presently seen as the
        open domain of both the global internet as a whole and the resources of public
        libraries world-wide, and therefore it is not seen as a limiting factor in
        the immediate future of the further development of Wikipedia.<ref name=\\\"Porter,

        Access to content ==\\n\\n=== Content licensing ===\\nWhen the project was
        started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by [[GNU Free Documentation
        License]] (GFDL), a [[copyleft]] license permitting the redistribution, creation
        of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright
        of their work.<ref name=\\\"WP copyright and commerciality 1\\\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Copyrights}}</ref>
        GFDL was created for software manuals that come with [[free software]] programs
        licensed under [[GPL]]. This made it a poor choice for a general reference
        work; for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia
        to come with a full copy of the GFDL license text. In December 2002, the [[Creative
        Commons license]] was released: it was specifically designed for creative
        works in general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity
        among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia
        project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.<ref name=\\\"WPF switch

        incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the
        [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) released a new version of GFDL designed
        specifically to allow Wikipedia to {{srlink|Wikipedia:Licensing update|relicense
        its content to CC BY-SA}} by August 1, 2009. (A new version of GFDL automatically
        covers Wikipedia contents.) In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects
        held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.<ref

        across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia,
        include non-free image files under [[fair use]] doctrine, while the others
        have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their
        home countries (e.g. in [[Copyright law of Japan|Japanese copyright law]]).
        Media files covered by [[free content]] licenses (e.g. Creative Commons' CC
        BY-SA) are shared across language editions via [[Wikimedia Commons]] repository,
        a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia's accommodation
        of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe

        The website [[DBpedia]], begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and

        from each page of Wikipedia and the other WMF wikis and make it available
        in a queriable [[Semantic Web|semantic]] format, [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]].
        This is still under development. As of Feb 2014 it has 15,000,000 items and

        reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, \\\"Only

        devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic
        for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to

        200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited

        written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first
        of these was the 1986 [[BBC Domesday Project]], which included text (entered
        on [[BBC Micro]] computers) and photographs from over 1&nbsp;million contributors
        in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was
        the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major
        multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of
        articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface
        and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website
        until 2008.<ref name=\\\"Domesday Project\\\" />\\n\\nOne of the most successful
        early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was [[h2g2]],
        which was created by [[Douglas Adams]]. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively
        light-hearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.
        [[Everything2]] was created in 1998. All of these projects had similarities
        with Wikipedia, but were not wikis and neither gave full editorial privileges
        to public users.\\n\\n[[GNE (encyclopedia)|GNE]], an encyclopedia which was
        not a wiki, also created in January 2001, co-existed with Nupedia and Wikipedia
        early in its history; however, it has been retired.<ref name=\\\"stallman1999\\\"
        />\\n\\nOther websites centered on collaborative [[knowledge base]] development
        have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as [[Susning.nu]], [[Enciclopedia
        Libre Universal en Espa\\u00f1ol|Enciclopedia Libre]], [[Hudong]], and [[Baidu
        Baike]] likewise employ no formal review process, although some like [[Conservapedia]]
        are not as open. Others use more traditional [[peer review]], such as [[Encyclopedia
        of Life]] and the online wiki encyclopedias [[Scholarpedia]] and [[Citizendium]].
        The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative
        to Wikipedia.<ref name=\\\"Orlowski18\\\" /><ref name=\\\"JayLyman\\\" />\\n\\n==

        (long question period), somewhat outdated, and only an elite audience will
        understand all topics (certainly not a first-time reader of this article).

        database model, MediaWiki's suitability for Wikimedia sites, AFD process,

        The [[English Wikipedia]] is now one of more than 200 Wikipedias, but remains
        the largest one, with {{srlink|Wikipedia:Size of Wikipedia|over {{#expr:0.1*floor

        tend to show that Wikipedia's accuracy is similar to Encyclopedia Britannica,
        with Wikipedia being much larger. However, critics have worried that [[Criticism
        of Wikipedia#Systemic bias in coverage|Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias]],
        and that its [[group dynamics]] hinder its goals. Most [[Academia|academics]],
        [[historian]]s, [[teacher]]s and [[journalist]]s reject Wikipedia as a reliable
        source of information for being a mixture of truths, half truths, and some
        falsehoods,<ref name=EdwinBlack/> and that as a resource about controversial
        topics, Wikipedia is notoriously subject to manipulation and spin.<ref name=Petrilli/>
        Wikipedia's [[WP:consensus|Consensus]] and [[WP:Undue|Undue Weight]] policies
        have been repeatedly criticised by prominent scholarly sources for undermining

        articles, and any Wikipedia article could be edited by any reader, even those
        who did not have a Wikipedia account. Modifications to all articles would
        immediately become available. As a result, all articles could contain inaccuracies,
        ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text until an editor would
        correct these issues.\\n\\n=== Restrictions ===\\nOver time, the English Wikipedia
        and some other Wikipedias gradually restricted modifications. For example,
        in the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered
        users may create a new article.<ref>{{srlink|Wikipedia:Tutorial/Registration|Registration
        notes}}</ref> On the English Wikipedia and some others, some particularly

        the [[German Wikipedia]] maintains \\\"stable versions\\\" of articles,<ref

        made by others. The \\\"History\\\" page of each article links to each revision.<ref

        infringements [[WP:Suppression|may be removed completely]].</ref><ref name=\\\"Torsten_Kleinz\\\"

        the article's history page. Anyone can view the [[Help:Recent changes|latest

        PhD student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low [[transaction cost]]s of
        participating in a [[wiki]] create a catalyst for collaborative development,

        Wikipedia}}\\n\\nAny edit that changes content in a way that deliberately
        compromises the integrity of Wikipedia is considered vandalism. The most common
        and obvious types of vandalism include insertion of obscenities and crude
        humor. Vandalism can also include advertising language and other types of
        [[Wikipedia:Spam|spam]].<ref name=\\\"upenn link spamming 1\\\">[http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1508&context=cis_papers

        vandalism by removing information or entirely blanking a given page. Less
        common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but
        false information to an article, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals
        can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's
        title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an article, or
        use images disruptively.<ref name=\\\"WP vandalism manipulation 1\\\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Vandalism|Vandalism}}.

        anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problem
        [\\u2026] which explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as
        a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise.
        As a community, far from being elitist, it is anti-elitist (which, in this
        context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs
        and disrespect of expertise is tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy
        that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did

        Wikipedia was cited by ''The Economist'' as substantially in contrast to statistics
        for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). ''The Economist''
        reported that the number of contributors with an average of five of more edits
        per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages
        at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about
        2,000 editors up or down. The attrition rates for editors in English Wikipedia,
        by sharp comparison, were cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000
        editors which has dropped to 30,000 editors as of the start of 2014. At the
        quoted trend rate, the number of active editors in English Wikipedia has lost
        approximately 20,000 editors to attrition since 2007, and the documented trend
        rate indicates the loss of another 20,000 editors by 2021, down to 10,000
        active editors on English Wikipedia by 2021 if left unabated.<ref name=\\\"economist1\\\"
        /> Given that the trend analysis published in ''The Economist'' presents the
        number of active editors for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia)
        as remaining relatively constant and successful in sustaining its numbers
        at approximately 42,000 active editors, the contrast has pointed to the effectiveness
        of Wikipedia in other languages to retain its active editors on a renewable
        and sustained basis.<ref name=\\\"economist1\\\" /> No comment was made concerning
        which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other
        languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to

        His research examined the [[counterproductive work behavior]] of edit warring.
        Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \\\"undo\\\" operations were not
        the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and
        relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting \\\"reverting/reverted
        pairs\\\" or \\\"mutually reverting edit pairs.\\\" Such a \\\"mutually reverting
        edit pair\\\" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor
        who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the \\\"mutually
        reverting edit pairs.\\\" The results were tabulated for all language versions
        of Wikipedia, with the English Wikipedia three largest conflict rates applying
        to articles about (i) ''G.W. Bush'', (ii) ''Anarchism'' and (iii) ''Mohammad''.<ref

        largest conflict rates at the time of the Oxford study were for the articles

        [[Porter five forces analysis]] framework for industry analysis, Wikipedia
        and its parent institution Wikimedia are known as \\\"first movers\\\" and
        \\\"radical innovators\\\" in the services provided and supported by an open-source,
        on-line encyclopedia.<ref name=\\\"Porter, M.E. 1985\\\">Porter, M.E. (1985)
        Competitive Advantage, Free Press, New York, 1985.</ref> The \\\"five forces\\\"
        are centered around the issue of \\\"competitive rivalry\\\" within the encyclopedia
        industry where Wikipedia is seen as having redefined by its \\\"radical innovation\\\"
        the parameters of effectiveness applied to conventional encyclopedia publication.
        This is the first force of Porter's five forces analysis.<ref name=\\\"Porter,
        M.E. 1980\\\">Porter, M.E. (1980) Competitive Strategy, Free Press, New York,
        1980.</ref> The second force is the \\\"threat of new entrants\\\" with competitive
        services and products possibly arising on the internet or the web. As a \\\"first
        mover\\\", Wikipedia has largely eluded the emergence of a [[fast second]]
        to challenge its radical innovation and its standing as the central provider
        of the services which it offers through the World Wide Web.<ref>Markides,
        Constantinos (2005). Fast Second, Wiley&Sons Inc., San Francisco, 2005</ref>
        Porter's third force is the \\\"threat of substitute products\\\" and it is
        too early to identify Google's \\\"Knowledge Graphs\\\" as an effective competitor
        given the current dependence of \\\"Knowledge Graphs\\\" upon Wikipedia's
        free access to its open-source services.<ref name=\\\"Porter, M.E. 1985\\\"
        /> The fourth force in the [[Porter five forces analysis]] is the \\\"bargaining
        power of consumers\\\" who use the services provided by Wikipedia, which has
        historically largely been nullified by the Wikipedia founding principle of
        an open invitation to expand and edit its content expressed in its moniker
        of being \\\"the encyclopedia which anyone can edit.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Porter,
        M.E. 1980\\\" /> The fifth force in the [[Porter five forces analysis]] is
        defined as the \\\"bargaining power of suppliers\\\", presently seen as the
        open domain of both the global internet as a whole and the resources of public
        libraries world-wide, and therefore it is not seen as a limiting factor in
        the immediate future of the further development of Wikipedia.<ref name=\\\"Porter,

        Access to content ==\\n\\n=== Content licensing ===\\nWhen the project was
        started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by [[GNU Free Documentation
        License]] (GFDL), a [[copyleft]] license permitting the redistribution, creation
        of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright
        of their work.<ref name=\\\"WP copyright and commerciality 1\\\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Copyrights}}</ref>
        GFDL was created for software manuals that come with [[free software]] programs
        licensed under [[GPL]]. This made it a poor choice for a general reference
        work; for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia
        to come with a full copy of the GFDL license text. In December 2002, the [[Creative
        Commons license]] was released: it was specifically designed for creative
        works in general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity
        among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia
        project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.<ref name=\\\"WPF switch

        incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the
        [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) released a new version of GFDL designed
        specifically to allow Wikipedia to {{srlink|Wikipedia:Licensing update|relicense
        its content to CC BY-SA}} by August 1, 2009. (A new version of GFDL automatically
        covers Wikipedia contents.) In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects
        held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.<ref

        across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia,
        include non-free image files under [[fair use]] doctrine, while the others
        have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their
        home countries (e.g. in [[Copyright law of Japan|Japanese copyright law]]).
        Media files covered by [[free content]] licenses (e.g. Creative Commons' CC
        BY-SA) are shared across language editions via [[Wikimedia Commons]] repository,
        a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia's accommodation
        of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe

        The website [[DBpedia]], begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and

        the [[Wikidata]] project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts
        from each page of Wikipedia and the other WMF wikis and make it available
        in a queriable [[Semantic Web|semantic]] format, [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]].
        This is still under development. As of Feb 2014 it has 15,000,000 items and
        1,000 properties for describing them.\\n\\nObtaining the full contents of

        through a fixed [[internet access|Internet connection]]. Although Wikipedia
        content has been accessible through the [[mobile web]] since July 2013, ''The
        New York Times'' on 9 February 2014 quoted Erik Moller, deputy director of
        the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic
        from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and
        worry.<ref name=\\\"small screen\\\" /> The ''The New York Times'' article
        reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, \\\"Only
        20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile
        devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic
        for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to
        mobile editing has lagged even more.\\\"<ref name=\\\"small screen\\\" />
        ''The New York Times'' reports that Mr. Moller of Wikimedia has assigned \\\"a
        team of 10 software developers focused on mobile,\\\" out of a total of approximately
        200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited
        by ''The New York Times'' for the \\\"worry\\\" is for Wikipedia to effectively
        address attrition issues with the number of editors which the on-line encyclopedia
        attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment.<ref

        Directly after the posted web interview, the representatives stated that Wikimedia
        would be applying an all-inclusive approach to accommodate as many mobile
        access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general mobile access,
        including BlackBerry and the Windows Phone system, making market share a secondary

        ==\\nA number of interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries
        written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first
        of these was the 1986 [[BBC Domesday Project]], which included text (entered
        on [[BBC Micro]] computers) and photographs from over 1&nbsp;million contributors
        in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was
        the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major
        multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of
        articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface
        and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website
        until 2008.<ref name=\\\"Domesday Project\\\" />\\n\\nOne of the most successful
        early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was [[h2g2]],
        which was created by [[Douglas Adams]]. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively
        light-hearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.
        [[Everything2]] was created in 1998. All of these projects had similarities
        with Wikipedia, but were not wikis and neither gave full editorial privileges
        to public users.\\n\\n[[GNE (encyclopedia)|GNE]], an encyclopedia which was
        not a wiki, also created in January 2001, co-existed with Nupedia and Wikipedia
        early in its history; however, it has been retired.<ref name=\\\"stallman1999\\\"
        />\\n\\nOther websites centered on collaborative [[knowledge base]] development
        have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as [[Susning.nu]], [[Enciclopedia
        Libre Universal en Espa\\u00f1ol|Enciclopedia Libre]], [[Hudong]], and [[Baidu
        Baike]] likewise employ no formal review process, although some like [[Conservapedia]]
        are not as open. Others use more traditional [[peer review]], such as [[Encyclopedia
        of Life]] and the online wiki encyclopedias [[Scholarpedia]] and [[Citizendium]].
        The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative

        long, in large part about the future (development), not presented with structure
        (long question period), somewhat outdated, and only an elite audience will
        understand all topics (certainly not a first-time reader of this article).
        Some topics: Visual editor (outdated), code review, wiki engines, MediaWiki's
        database model, MediaWiki's suitability for Wikimedia sites, AFD process,
        flagged revisions and proposed more advanced revision selection mechanisms,

        tend to show that Wikipedia's accuracy is similar to Encyclopedia Britannica,
        with Wikipedia being much larger. However, critics have worried that [[Criticism
        of Wikipedia#Systemic bias in coverage|Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias]],
        and that its [[group dynamics]] hinder its goals. Most [[Academia|academics]],
        [[historian]]s, [[teacher]]s and [[journalist]]s reject Wikipedia as a reliable
        source of information for being a mixture of truths, half truths, and some
        falsehoods,<ref name=EdwinBlack/> and that as a resource about controversial

        Wikipedia's [[WP:consensus|Consensus]] and [[WP:Undue|Undue Weight]] policies
        have been repeatedly criticised by prominent scholarly sources for undermining

        articles, and any Wikipedia article could be edited by any reader, even those
        who did not have a Wikipedia account. Modifications to all articles would

        ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text until an editor would
        correct these issues.\\n\\n=== Restrictions ===\\nOver time, the English Wikipedia
        and some other Wikipedias gradually restricted modifications. For example,
        in the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered
        users may create a new article.<ref>{{srlink|Wikipedia:Tutorial/Registration|Registration

        vandalism by removing information or entirely blanking a given page. Less
        common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but
        false information to an article, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals
        can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's
        title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an article, or
        use images disruptively.<ref name=\\\"WP vandalism manipulation 1\\\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Vandalism|Vandalism}}.

        anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problem
        [\\u2026] which explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as
        a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise.
        As a community, far from being elitist, it is anti-elitist (which, in this
        context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs
        and disrespect of expertise is tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy
        that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did
        not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely

        Wikipedia was cited by ''The Economist'' as substantially in contrast to statistics
        for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). ''The Economist''
        reported that the number of contributors with an average of five of more edits
        per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages
        at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about
        2,000 editors up or down. The attrition rates for editors in English Wikipedia,
        by sharp comparison, were cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000
        editors which has dropped to 30,000 editors as of the start of 2014. At the
        quoted trend rate, the number of active editors in English Wikipedia has lost
        approximately 20,000 editors to attrition since 2007, and the documented trend
        rate indicates the loss of another 20,000 editors by 2021, down to 10,000
        active editors on English Wikipedia by 2021 if left unabated.<ref name=\\\"economist1\\\"
        /> Given that the trend analysis published in ''The Economist'' presents the
        number of active editors for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia)
        as remaining relatively constant and successful in sustaining its numbers
        at approximately 42,000 active editors, the contrast has pointed to the effectiveness
        of Wikipedia in other languages to retain its active editors on a renewable
        and sustained basis.<ref name=\\\"economist1\\\" /> No comment was made concerning
        which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other
        languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to

        His research examined the [[counterproductive work behavior]] of edit warring.
        Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \\\"undo\\\" operations were not
        the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and
        relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting \\\"reverting/reverted
        pairs\\\" or \\\"mutually reverting edit pairs.\\\" Such a \\\"mutually reverting
        edit pair\\\" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor
        who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the \\\"mutually
        reverting edit pairs.\\\" The results were tabulated for all language versions
        of Wikipedia, with the English Wikipedia three largest conflict rates applying
        to articles about (i) ''G.W. Bush'', (ii) ''Anarchism'' and (iii) ''Mohammad''.<ref
        name=\\\"autogenerated3\\\" /> By comparison, for German Wikipedia the three
        largest conflict rates at the time of the Oxford study were for the articles
        covering (i) ''Croatia'', (ii) ''Scientology'' and (iii) ''9/11 Conspiracy
        Theories''.<ref name=\\\"autogenerated3\\\" />\\n\\n=== Explicit content ===\\n{{main

        double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase

        The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the [[Exponential

        [[Porter five forces analysis]] framework for industry analysis, Wikipedia
        and its parent institution Wikimedia are known as \\\"first movers\\\" and
        \\\"radical innovators\\\" in the services provided and supported by an open-source,
        on-line encyclopedia.<ref name=\\\"Porter, M.E. 1985\\\">Porter, M.E. (1985)
        Competitive Advantage, Free Press, New York, 1985.</ref> The \\\"five forces\\\"
        are centered around the issue of \\\"competitive rivalry\\\" within the encyclopedia
        industry where Wikipedia is seen as having redefined by its \\\"radical innovation\\\"
        the parameters of effectiveness applied to conventional encyclopedia publication.
        This is the first force of Porter's five forces analysis.<ref name=\\\"Porter,
        M.E. 1980\\\">Porter, M.E. (1980) Competitive Strategy, Free Press, New York,
        1980.</ref> The second force is the \\\"threat of new entrants\\\" with competitive
        services and products possibly arising on the internet or the web. As a \\\"first
        mover\\\", Wikipedia has largely eluded the emergence of a [[fast second]]
        to challenge its radical innovation and its standing as the central provider
        of the services which it offers through the World Wide Web.<ref>Markides,
        Constantinos (2005). Fast Second, Wiley&Sons Inc., San Francisco, 2005</ref>
        Porter's third force is the \\\"threat of substitute products\\\" and it is
        too early to identify Google's \\\"Knowledge Graphs\\\" as an effective competitor
        given the current dependence of \\\"Knowledge Graphs\\\" upon Wikipedia's
        free access to its open-source services.<ref name=\\\"Porter, M.E. 1985\\\"
        /> The fourth force in the [[Porter five forces analysis]] is the \\\"bargaining
        power of consumers\\\" who use the services provided by Wikipedia, which has
        historically largely been nullified by the Wikipedia founding principle of
        an open invitation to expand and edit its content expressed in its moniker
        of being \\\"the encyclopedia which anyone can edit.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Porter,
        M.E. 1980\\\" /> The fifth force in the [[Porter five forces analysis]] is
        defined as the \\\"bargaining power of suppliers\\\", presently seen as the
        open domain of both the global internet as a whole and the resources of public
        libraries world-wide, and therefore it is not seen as a limiting factor in
        the immediate future of the further development of Wikipedia.<ref name=\\\"Porter,

        Access to content ==\\n\\n=== Content licensing ===\\nWhen the project was
        started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by [[GNU Free Documentation
        License]] (GFDL), a [[copyleft]] license permitting the redistribution, creation
        of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright
        of their work.<ref name=\\\"WP copyright and commerciality 1\\\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Copyrights}}</ref>
        GFDL was created for software manuals that come with [[free software]] programs
        licensed under [[GPL]]. This made it a poor choice for a general reference
        work; for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia
        to come with a full copy of the GFDL license text. In December 2002, the [[Creative
        Commons license]] was released: it was specifically designed for creative
        works in general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity
        among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia
        project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.<ref name=\\\"WPF switch

        incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the
        [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) released a new version of GFDL designed
        specifically to allow Wikipedia to {{srlink|Wikipedia:Licensing update|relicense

        across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia,
        include non-free image files under [[fair use]] doctrine, while the others
        have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their
        home countries (e.g. in [[Copyright law of Japan|Japanese copyright law]]).
        Media files covered by [[free content]] licenses (e.g. Creative Commons' CC
        BY-SA) are shared across language editions via [[Wikimedia Commons]] repository,
        a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia's accommodation
        of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe
        that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic

        The website [[DBpedia]], begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and
        category declarations of the English-language Wikipedia. Wikimedia has created
        the [[Wikidata]] project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts
        from each page of Wikipedia and the other WMF wikis and make it available
        in a queriable [[Semantic Web|semantic]] format, [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]].
        This is still under development. As of Feb 2014 it has 15,000,000 items and
        1,000 properties for describing them.\\n\\nObtaining the full contents of

        medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard [[web browser]]
        through a fixed [[internet access|Internet connection]]. Although Wikipedia
        content has been accessible through the [[mobile web]] since July 2013, ''The
        New York Times'' on 9 February 2014 quoted Erik Moller, deputy director of
        the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic
        from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and
        worry.<ref name=\\\"small screen\\\" /> The ''The New York Times'' article
        reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, \\\"Only
        20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile
        devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic
        for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to
        mobile editing has lagged even more.\\\"<ref name=\\\"small screen\\\" />
        ''The New York Times'' reports that Mr. Moller of Wikimedia has assigned \\\"a
        team of 10 software developers focused on mobile,\\\" out of a total of approximately
        200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited
        by ''The New York Times'' for the \\\"worry\\\" is for Wikipedia to effectively
        address attrition issues with the number of editors which the on-line encyclopedia
        attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment.<ref

        2014 that Google's Android mobile apps have dominated the largest share of

        in May 2014, Wikimedia representatives made a technical announcement concerning
        the number of mobile access systems in the market seeking access to Wikipedia.
        Directly after the posted web interview, the representatives stated that Wikimedia
        would be applying an all-inclusive approach to accommodate as many mobile
        access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general mobile access,
        including BlackBerry and the Windows Phone system, making market share a secondary

        ==\\nA number of interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries
        written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first
        of these was the 1986 [[BBC Domesday Project]], which included text (entered
        on [[BBC Micro]] computers) and photographs from over 1&nbsp;million contributors
        in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was
        the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major
        multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of
        articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface
        and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website
        until 2008.<ref name=\\\"Domesday Project\\\" />\\n\\nOne of the most successful
        early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was [[h2g2]],
        which was created by [[Douglas Adams]]. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively
        light-hearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.
        [[Everything2]] was created in 1998. All of these projects had similarities
        with Wikipedia, but were not wikis and neither gave full editorial privileges
        to public users.\\n\\n[[GNE (encyclopedia)|GNE]], an encyclopedia which was
        not a wiki, also created in January 2001, co-existed with Nupedia and Wikipedia
        early in its history; however, it has been retired.<ref name=\\\"stallman1999\\\"
        />\\n\\nOther websites centered on collaborative [[knowledge base]] development
        have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as [[Susning.nu]], [[Enciclopedia
        Libre Universal en Espa\\u00f1ol|Enciclopedia Libre]], [[Hudong]], and [[Baidu
        Baike]] likewise employ no formal review process, although some like [[Conservapedia]]
        are not as open. Others use more traditional [[peer review]], such as [[Encyclopedia
        of Life]] and the online wiki encyclopedias [[Scholarpedia]] and [[Citizendium]].
        The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative

        as a software developer and Wikimedia quasi-expert. Interesting but sparse
        subjects are treated. While many readers may find parts interesting, it is
        long, in large part about the future (development), not presented with structure
        (long question period), somewhat outdated, and only an elite audience will
        understand all topics (certainly not a first-time reader of this article).
        Some topics: Visual editor (outdated), code review, wiki engines, MediaWiki's
        database model, MediaWiki's suitability for Wikimedia sites, AFD process,
        flagged revisions and proposed more advanced revision selection mechanisms,

        tend to show that Wikipedia's accuracy is similar to Encyclopedia Britannica,
        with Wikipedia being much larger. However, critics have worried that [[Criticism

        and that its [[group dynamics]] hinder its goals. Most [[Academia|academics]],
        [[historian]]s, [[teacher]]s and [[journalist]]s reject Wikipedia as a reliable

        correct these issues.\\n\\n=== Restrictions ===\\nOver time, the English Wikipedia
        and some other Wikipedias gradually restricted modifications. For example,

        vandalism by removing information or entirely blanking a given page. Less
        common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but
        false information to an article, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals
        can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's
        title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an article, or
        use images disruptively.<ref name=\\\"WP vandalism manipulation 1\\\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Vandalism|Vandalism}}.

        anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problem
        [\\u2026] which explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as
        a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise.
        As a community, far from being elitist, it is anti-elitist (which, in this
        context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs
        and disrespect of expertise is tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy
        that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did
        not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely
        to experts. (Those who were there will, I hope, remember that I tried very

        Wikipedia was cited by ''The Economist'' as substantially in contrast to statistics
        for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). ''The Economist''
        reported that the number of contributors with an average of five of more edits
        per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages
        at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about
        2,000 editors up or down. The attrition rates for editors in English Wikipedia,
        by sharp comparison, were cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000
        editors which has dropped to 30,000 editors as of the start of 2014. At the
        quoted trend rate, the number of active editors in English Wikipedia has lost
        approximately 20,000 editors to attrition since 2007, and the documented trend
        rate indicates the loss of another 20,000 editors by 2021, down to 10,000
        active editors on English Wikipedia by 2021 if left unabated.<ref name=\\\"economist1\\\"
        /> Given that the trend analysis published in ''The Economist'' presents the
        number of active editors for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia)
        as remaining relatively constant and successful in sustaining its numbers
        at approximately 42,000 active editors, the contrast has pointed to the effectiveness
        of Wikipedia in other languages to retain its active editors on a renewable
        and sustained basis.<ref name=\\\"economist1\\\" /> No comment was made concerning
        which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other
        languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to

        His research examined the [[counterproductive work behavior]] of edit warring.
        Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \\\"undo\\\" operations were not
        the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and
        relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting \\\"reverting/reverted
        pairs\\\" or \\\"mutually reverting edit pairs.\\\" Such a \\\"mutually reverting
        edit pair\\\" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor
        who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the \\\"mutually
        reverting edit pairs.\\\" The results were tabulated for all language versions
        of Wikipedia, with the English Wikipedia three largest conflict rates applying
        to articles about (i) ''G.W. Bush'', (ii) ''Anarchism'' and (iii) ''Mohammad''.<ref

        double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase

        database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by [[Magnus Manske]].
        The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the [[Exponential

        \\\"Start\\\", \\\"C\\\" and \\\"B\\\" (in increasing order of quality). Community
        peer review is needed for the article to enter one of the highest quality
        classes: either \\\"A\\\", \\\"[[WP:Good articles|good article]]\\\" or the
        highest, \\\"[[WP:Featured articles|featured article]]\\\". Of the total of
        about 4.4 million articles assessed as of 11 December 2013, approximately

        [[Porter five forces analysis]] framework for industry analysis, Wikipedia
        and its parent institution Wikimedia are known as \\\"first movers\\\" and
        \\\"radical innovators\\\" in the services provided and supported by an open-source,
        on-line encyclopedia.<ref name=\\\"Porter, M.E. 1985\\\">Porter, M.E. (1985)
        Competitive Advantage, Free Press, New York, 1985.</ref> The \\\"five forces\\\"
        are centered around the issue of \\\"competitive rivalry\\\" within the encyclopedia
        industry where Wikipedia is seen as having redefined by its \\\"radical innovation\\\"
        the parameters of effectiveness applied to conventional encyclopedia publication.
        This is the first force of Porter's five forces analysis.<ref name=\\\"Porter,
        M.E. 1980\\\">Porter, M.E. (1980) Competitive Strategy, Free Press, New York,
        1980.</ref> The second force is the \\\"threat of new entrants\\\" with competitive
        services and products possibly arising on the internet or the web. As a \\\"first
        mover\\\", Wikipedia has largely eluded the emergence of a [[fast second]]
        to challenge its radical innovation and its standing as the central provider
        of the services which it offers through the World Wide Web.<ref>Markides,
        Constantinos (2005). Fast Second, Wiley&Sons Inc., San Francisco, 2005</ref>
        Porter's third force is the \\\"threat of substitute products\\\" and it is
        too early to identify Google's \\\"Knowledge Graphs\\\" as an effective competitor
        given the current dependence of \\\"Knowledge Graphs\\\" upon Wikipedia's
        free access to its open-source services.<ref name=\\\"Porter, M.E. 1985\\\"
        /> The fourth force in the [[Porter five forces analysis]] is the \\\"bargaining
        power of consumers\\\" who use the services provided by Wikipedia, which has
        historically largely been nullified by the Wikipedia founding principle of
        an open invitation to expand and edit its content expressed in its moniker
        of being \\\"the encyclopedia which anyone can edit.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Porter,
        M.E. 1980\\\" /> The fifth force in the [[Porter five forces analysis]] is
        defined as the \\\"bargaining power of suppliers\\\", presently seen as the
        open domain of both the global internet as a whole and the resources of public
        libraries world-wide, and therefore it is not seen as a limiting factor in
        the immediate future of the further development of Wikipedia.<ref name=\\\"Porter,

        Access to content ==\\n\\n=== Content licensing ===\\nWhen the project was
        started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by [[GNU Free Documentation
        License]] (GFDL), a [[copyleft]] license permitting the redistribution, creation
        of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright
        of their work.<ref name=\\\"WP copyright and commerciality 1\\\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Copyrights}}</ref>
        GFDL was created for software manuals that come with [[free software]] programs
        licensed under [[GPL]]. This made it a poor choice for a general reference
        work; for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia
        to come with a full copy of the GFDL license text. In December 2002, the [[Creative
        Commons license]] was released: it was specifically designed for creative
        works in general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity
        among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia
        project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.<ref name=\\\"WPF switch

        incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the
        [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) released a new version of GFDL designed
        specifically to allow Wikipedia to {{srlink|Wikipedia:Licensing update|relicense
        its content to CC BY-SA}} by August 1, 2009. (A new version of GFDL automatically
        covers Wikipedia contents.) In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects
        held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.<ref

        across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia,
        include non-free image files under [[fair use]] doctrine, while the others
        have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their
        home countries (e.g. in [[Copyright law of Japan|Japanese copyright law]]).
        Media files covered by [[free content]] licenses (e.g. Creative Commons' CC
        BY-SA) are shared across language editions via [[Wikimedia Commons]] repository,
        a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia's accommodation
        of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe
        that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic

        the [[Wikidata]] project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts
        from each page of Wikipedia and the other WMF wikis and make it available
        in a queriable [[Semantic Web|semantic]] format, [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]].

        through a fixed [[internet access|Internet connection]]. Although Wikipedia
        content has been accessible through the [[mobile web]] since July 2013, ''The
        New York Times'' on 9 February 2014 quoted Erik Moller, deputy director of
        the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic
        from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and
        worry.<ref name=\\\"small screen\\\" /> The ''The New York Times'' article
        reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, \\\"Only
        20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile
        devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic
        for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to
        mobile editing has lagged even more.\\\"<ref name=\\\"small screen\\\" />
        ''The New York Times'' reports that Mr. Moller of Wikimedia has assigned \\\"a
        team of 10 software developers focused on mobile,\\\" out of a total of approximately
        200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited
        by ''The New York Times'' for the \\\"worry\\\" is for Wikipedia to effectively
        address attrition issues with the number of editors which the on-line encyclopedia
        attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment.<ref

        Directly after the posted web interview, the representatives stated that Wikimedia
        would be applying an all-inclusive approach to accommodate as many mobile
        access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general mobile access,

        ==\\nA number of interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries
        written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first
        of these was the 1986 [[BBC Domesday Project]], which included text (entered
        on [[BBC Micro]] computers) and photographs from over 1&nbsp;million contributors
        in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was
        the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major
        multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of
        articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface
        and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website
        until 2008.<ref name=\\\"Domesday Project\\\" />\\n\\nOne of the most successful
        early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was [[h2g2]],
        which was created by [[Douglas Adams]]. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively
        light-hearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.
        [[Everything2]] was created in 1998. All of these projects had similarities
        with Wikipedia, but were not wikis and neither gave full editorial privileges
        to public users.\\n\\n[[GNE (encyclopedia)|GNE]], an encyclopedia which was
        not a wiki, also created in January 2001, co-existed with Nupedia and Wikipedia
        early in its history; however, it has been retired.<ref name=\\\"stallman1999\\\"
        />\\n\\nOther websites centered on collaborative [[knowledge base]] development
        have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as [[Susning.nu]], [[Enciclopedia
        Libre Universal en Espa\\u00f1ol|Enciclopedia Libre]], [[Hudong]], and [[Baidu
        Baike]] likewise employ no formal review process, although some like [[Conservapedia]]
        are not as open. Others use more traditional [[peer review]], such as [[Encyclopedia
        of Life]] and the online wiki encyclopedias [[Scholarpedia]] and [[Citizendium]].
        The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative
        to Wikipedia.<ref name=\\\"Orlowski18\\\" /><ref name=\\\"JayLyman\\\" />\\n\\n==

        subjects are treated. While many readers may find parts interesting, it is
        long, in large part about the future (development), not presented with structure
        (long question period), somewhat outdated, and only an elite audience will
        understand all topics (certainly not a first-time reader of this article).
        Some topics: Visual editor (outdated), code review, wiki engines, MediaWiki's
        database model, MediaWiki's suitability for Wikimedia sites, AFD process,
        flagged revisions and proposed more advanced revision selection mechanisms,

        tend to show that Wikipedia's accuracy is similar to Encyclopedia Britannica,

        vandalism by removing information or entirely blanking a given page. Less
        common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but
        false information to an article, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals
        can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's
        title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an article, or

        a certain mindset associated with unmoderated Usenet groups [\\u2026] that
        infects the collectively-managed Wikipedia project: if you react strongly
        to trolling, that reflects poorly on you, not (necessarily) on the troll.
        If you [\\u2026] demand that something be done about constant disruption by
        trollish behavior, the other listmembers will cry \\\"censorship,\\\" attack
        you, and even come to the defense of the troll. [\\u2026] The root problem:
        anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problem
        [\\u2026] which explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as
        a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise.
        As a community, far from being elitist, it is anti-elitist (which, in this
        context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs
        and disrespect of expertise is tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy
        that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did
        not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely
        to experts. (Those who were there will, I hope, remember that I tried very

        Wikipedia was cited by ''The Economist'' as substantially in contrast to statistics
        for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). ''The Economist''
        reported that the number of contributors with an average of five of more edits
        per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages
        at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about
        2,000 editors up or down. The attrition rates for editors in English Wikipedia,
        by sharp comparison, were cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000
        editors which has dropped to 30,000 editors as of the start of 2014. At the
        quoted trend rate, the number of active editors in English Wikipedia has lost
        approximately 20,000 editors to attrition since 2007, and the documented trend
        rate indicates the loss of another 20,000 editors by 2021, down to 10,000
        active editors on English Wikipedia by 2021 if left unabated.<ref name=\\\"economist1\\\"
        /> Given that the trend analysis published in ''The Economist'' presents the
        number of active editors for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia)
        as remaining relatively constant and successful in sustaining its numbers
        at approximately 42,000 active editors, the contrast has pointed to the effectiveness
        of Wikipedia in other languages to retain its active editors on a renewable
        and sustained basis.<ref name=\\\"economist1\\\" /> No comment was made concerning
        which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other

        interpretive stance in Wikipedia history\\\". By example, he quoted the conclusion
        of Wikipedia's article on [[William Clarke Quantrill]]. While generally praising
        the article, he pointed out its \\\"waffling\\\" conclusion: \\\"Some historians

        are factually accurate, they are often written in a poor, almost unreadable
        style. Frequent Wikipedia critic Andrew Orlowski commented: \\\"Even when
        a Wikipedia entry is 100 per cent factually correct, and those facts have

        Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \\\"undo\\\" operations were not

        relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting \\\"reverting/reverted

        edit pair\\\" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor
        who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the \\\"mutually
        reverting edit pairs.\\\" The results were tabulated for all language versions
        of Wikipedia, with the English Wikipedia three largest conflict rates applying
        to articles about (i) ''G.W. Bush'', (ii) ''Anarchism'' and (iii) ''Mohammad''.<ref

        MediaWiki is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] and it is used
        by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. Originally,
        Wikipedia ran on [[UseModWiki]] written in [[Perl]] by Clifford Adams (Phase
        I), which initially required [[CamelCase]] for article hyperlinks; the present
        double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase
        II), Wikipedia began running on a [[PhpWiki|PHP wiki]] engine with a MySQL
        database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by [[Magnus Manske]].
        The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the [[Exponential
        growth|exponentially increasing]] demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia
        shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by
        [[Lee Daniel Crocker]].\\n\\nSeveral MediaWiki extensions are installed<ref

        [[Porter five forces analysis]] framework for industry analysis, Wikipedia
        and its parent institution Wikimedia are known as \\\"first movers\\\" and
        \\\"radical innovators\\\" in the services provided and supported by an open-source,
        on-line encyclopedia.<ref name=\\\"Porter, M.E. 1985\\\">Porter, M.E. (1985)
        Competitive Advantage, Free Press, New York, 1985.</ref> The \\\"five forces\\\"
        are centered around the issue of \\\"competitive rivalry\\\" within the encyclopedia
        industry where Wikipedia is seen as having redefined by its \\\"radical innovation\\\"
        the parameters of effectiveness applied to conventional encyclopedia publication.
        This is the first force of Porter's five forces analysis.<ref name=\\\"Porter,
        M.E. 1980\\\">Porter, M.E. (1980) Competitive Strategy, Free Press, New York,
        1980.</ref> The second force is the \\\"threat of new entrants\\\" with competitive
        services and products possibly arising on the internet or the web. As a \\\"first
        mover\\\", Wikipedia has largely eluded the emergence of a [[fast second]]
        to challenge its radical innovation and its standing as the central provider
        of the services which it offers through the World Wide Web.<ref>Markides,
        Constantinos (2005). Fast Second, Wiley&Sons Inc., San Francisco, 2005</ref>
        Porter's third force is the \\\"threat of substitute products\\\" and it is
        too early to identify Google's \\\"Knowledge Graphs\\\" as an effective competitor
        given the current dependence of \\\"Knowledge Graphs\\\" upon Wikipedia's
        free access to its open-source services.<ref name=\\\"Porter, M.E. 1985\\\"
        /> The fourth force in the [[Porter five forces analysis]] is the \\\"bargaining
        power of consumers\\\" who use the services provided by Wikipedia, which has
        historically largely been nullified by the Wikipedia founding principle of
        an open invitation to expand and edit its content expressed in its moniker
        of being \\\"the encyclopedia which anyone can edit.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Porter,
        M.E. 1980\\\" /> The fifth force in the [[Porter five forces analysis]] is
        defined as the \\\"bargaining power of suppliers\\\", presently seen as the
        open domain of both the global internet as a whole and the resources of public
        libraries world-wide, and therefore it is not seen as a limiting factor in
        the immediate future of the further development of Wikipedia.<ref name=\\\"Porter,

        of specific WikiProjects like [[Wikipedia:BUGLE|''The Bugle'']] from [[WP:Milhist|WikiProject
        Military History]] and the monthly newsletter from [[WP:GOCE|The Guild of

        Access to content ==\\n\\n=== Content licensing ===\\nWhen the project was
        started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by [[GNU Free Documentation
        License]] (GFDL), a [[copyleft]] license permitting the redistribution, creation
        of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright
        of their work.<ref name=\\\"WP copyright and commerciality 1\\\">{{srlink|Wikipedia:Copyrights}}</ref>
        GFDL was created for software manuals that come with [[free software]] programs
        licensed under [[GPL]]. This made it a poor choice for a general reference
        work; for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia
        to come with a full copy of the GFDL license text. In December 2002, the [[Creative
        Commons license]] was released: it was specifically designed for creative
        works in general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity
        among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia
        project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.<ref name=\\\"WPF switch

        update|year=2007|author=Walter Vermeir|publisher=Wikizine|accessdate=December
        4, 2007}}</ref> Because the two licenses, GFDL and Creative Commons, were
        incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the
        [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) released a new version of GFDL designed
        specifically to allow Wikipedia to {{srlink|Wikipedia:Licensing update|relicense
        its content to CC BY-SA}} by August 1, 2009. (A new version of GFDL automatically
        covers Wikipedia contents.) In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects
        held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.<ref

        across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia,
        include non-free image files under [[fair use]] doctrine, while the others
        have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their
        home countries (e.g. in [[Copyright law of Japan|Japanese copyright law]]).
        Media files covered by [[free content]] licenses (e.g. Creative Commons' CC
        BY-SA) are shared across language editions via [[Wikimedia Commons]] repository,
        a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia's accommodation
        of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe
        that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic
        text.<ref name=\\\"NYT photos on WP\\\">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/arts/20funny.html|title=Wikipedia

        The website [[DBpedia]], begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and

        the [[Wikidata]] project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts
        from each page of Wikipedia and the other WMF wikis and make it available
        in a queriable [[Semantic Web|semantic]] format, [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]].

        through a fixed [[internet access|Internet connection]]. Although Wikipedia
        content has been accessible through the [[mobile web]] since July 2013, ''The
        New York Times'' on 9 February 2014 quoted Erik Moller, deputy director of
        the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic
        from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and
        worry.<ref name=\\\"small screen\\\" /> The ''The New York Times'' article
        reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, \\\"Only
        20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile
        devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic
        for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to
        mobile editing has lagged even more.\\\"<ref name=\\\"small screen\\\" />
        ''The New York Times'' reports that Mr. Moller of Wikimedia has assigned \\\"a
        team of 10 software developers focused on mobile,\\\" out of a total of approximately
        200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited
        by ''The New York Times'' for the \\\"worry\\\" is for Wikipedia to effectively

        Directly after the posted web interview, the representatives stated that Wikimedia

        ==\\nA number of interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries
        written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first
        of these was the 1986 [[BBC Domesday Project]], which included text (entered
        on [[BBC Micro]] computers) and photographs from over 1&nbsp;million contributors
        in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was
        the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major
        multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of
        articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface
        and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website
        until 2008.<ref name=\\\"Domesday Project\\\" />\\n\\nOne of the most successful
        early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was [[h2g2]],
        which was created by [[Douglas Adams]]. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively
        light-hearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.
        [[Everything2]] was created in 1998. All of these projects had similarities
        with Wikipedia, but were not wikis and neither gave full editorial privileges
        to public users.\\n\\n[[GNE (encyclopedia)|GNE]], an encyclopedia which was
        not a wiki, also created in January 2001, co-existed with Nupedia and Wikipedia
        early in its history; however, it has been retired.<ref name=\\\"stallman1999\\\"
        />\\n\\nOther websites centered on collaborative [[knowledge base]] development
        have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as [[Susning.nu]], [[Enciclopedia
        Libre Universal en Espa\\u00f1ol|Enciclopedia Libre]], [[Hudong]], and [[Baidu
        Baike]] likewise employ no formal review process, although some like [[Conservapedia]]
        are not as open. Others use more traditional [[peer review]], such as [[Encyclopedia
        of Life]] and the online wiki encyclopedias [[Scholarpedia]] and [[Citizendium]].
        The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative
        to Wikipedia.<ref name=\\\"Orlowski18\\\" /><ref name=\\\"JayLyman\\\" />\\n\\n==

        as a software developer and Wikimedia quasi-expert. Interesting but sparse
        subjects are treated. While many readers may find parts interesting, it is
        long, in large part about the future (development), not presented with structure
        (long question period), somewhat outdated, and only an elite audience will
        understand all topics (certainly not a first-time reader of this article).
        Some topics: Visual editor (outdated), code review, wiki engines, MediaWiki's
        database model, MediaWiki's suitability for Wikimedia sites, AFD process,
        flagged revisions and proposed more advanced revision selection mechanisms,
        communication channels (mostly IRC / real-time). User:Chealer 20140817 -->\\n*
