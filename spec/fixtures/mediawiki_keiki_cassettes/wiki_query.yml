        and [[command (computing)|command]]s whose purpose is unimportant and serve
        only to demonstrate a concept.  The words themselves have no meaning in this
        usage.  ''''Foobar'''' is sometimes used alone; ''''foo'''', ''''bar'''',
        and ''''baz'''' are sometimes used, when multiple entities are needed.\n\nThe
        usage in [[computer programming]] examples and [[pseudocode]] varies; in certain
        circles, it is used extensively, but many prefer descriptive names, while
        others prefer to use single letters.  [[Eric S. Raymond]] has called it an
        \"important hackerism\" alongside [[kludge]] and [[cruft]].<ref name=\"Raymond\">{{cite

        as a [[nonsense word]] from the 1930s, the military term [[FUBAR]] emerged
        in the 1940s, and the use of ''''foo'''' in a programming context is generally
        credited to the [[Tech Model Railroad Club]] (TMRC) of [[Massachusetts Institute
        of Technology|MIT]] from circa 1960.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3092.txt|title=Etymology
        of \"Foo\"}}</ref> However, the precise relationship of these terms is not
        known with certainty, and several anecdotal theories have been advanced to
        identify them.\n\nThe etymology of ''''foo'''' is explored in the [[Internet
        Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) RFC 3092, which gives the earliest documented
        use as being in the 1930s comic ''''[[Smokey Stover]]'''' by [[Bill Holman
        (cartoonist)|Bill Holman]], where it is used as a nonsense word.<ref name=\"jargon\">http://catb.org/jargon/html/F/foo.html
        foo</ref><ref>http://catb.org/jargon/html/index.html</ref> Holman states that
        he used the word due to having seen it on bottom of a jade Chinese figurine
        in [[Chinatown, San Francisco]], meaning \"good luck\".<ref>http://www.smokey-stover.com/history.html</ref><ref>[http://www.smokey-stover.com/
        smokey-stover.com]</ref><ref>http://members.aol.com/EOCostello/</ref> This
        is presumably as a transliteration of the [[fu character]] (f\u00fa, \u798f),
        which is a common character for fortune, and figurines of the trio of eponymous
        male \"star gods\" ''''[[Fu Lu Shou|F\u00fa, L\u00f9, Sh\u00f2u]]'''' are
        common in Chinese communities; compare [[Fu Manchu]], fictional character
        popular in the 1930s. ''''Smokey Stover'''' ran 1935\u201373, and continued
        to feature ''''foo'''' prominently, as on the front of the \"foomobile\" illustrated
        in the cover at right. The word ''''foo'''' became very popular in the 1930s,
        and also appeared in other cartoons including the ''''[[Looney Tunes]]''''
        cartoons of [[Bob Clampett]] such as ''''[[The Daffy Doc]]'''' and ''''[[Porky
        in Wackyland]]'''' (both 1938, with [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Porky Pig]]), and
        in other comic strips such as ''''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]''''.\n\nFrom there,
        the Foo migrated into military slang, merged with \"FU\" of the [[FUBAR]].<ref
        name=\"rfc3092\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3092.txt|title=Etymology

        was used by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] aircraft pilots in [[World War
        II]] to describe various [[unidentified flying object|UFOs]] or mysterious
        aerial phenomena.\n\nThe first known use of the terms in print in a programming
        context appears in a 1965 edition of MIT''s \"Tech Engineering News\".<ref>{{cite

        address; e.g., if an instruction such as \"add 1 foo\" were used, specifying
        indirect addressing thru location \"foo\", and location \"foo\" contained
        the address of location \"foobar\", than an effective word search for \"foobar\"
        would find location \"foo\" and the location containing the \"add\" instruction
        as well.}}</ref> ''''Foobar'''' may have come about as a result of the pre-existing
        \"Foo\" being conjoined with \"bar\" an addition borrowed from the military''s
        FUBAR. The use of ''''foo'''' in hacker and eventually in programming context
        may have begun in MIT''s [[Tech Model Railroad Club]] (TMRC). In the complex
        model system, there were [[scram]] switches located at numerous places around
        the room that could be thrown if something undesirable was about to occur,
        such as a train going full-bore at an obstruction. Another feature of the
        system was a digital clock on the dispatch board. When someone hit a scram
        switch the clock stopped and the display was replaced with the word \"FOO\";
        at TMRC the scram switches are therefore called \"Foo switches\". Because
        of this, an entry in the 1959 Dictionary of the TMRC Language went something
        like this: \"FOO: The first syllable of the misquoted sacred chant phrase
        ''[[Om mani padme hum|foo mane padme hum]].'' Our first obligation is to keep
        the foo counters turning.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computer-dictionary-online.org/?q=foo|title=Computer
        Dictionary Online}}, computer-dictionary-online.org</ref> One book{{which|date=November
        2010}} describing the MIT train room describes two buttons by the door: labelled
        foo and bar. These were general purpose buttons and were often re-purposed
        for whatever fun idea the MIT hackers had at the time, hence the adoption
        of foo and bar as general purpose variable names. An entry in the \"Abridged
        Dictionary of the TMRC Language\" states:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tmrc.mit.edu/dictionary.html|title=Abridged
        Dictionary of the TMRC Language|publisher=[[MIT]]}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text
        = Multiflush: stop-all-trains-button. Next best thing to the red door button.
        Also called FOO. Displays \"FOO\" on the clock when used.}}\n\nThe term ''''foobar''''
        was propagated through computer science circles in the 1960s and early 1970s
        by system manuals from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]].{{citation needed|date=May
        2009}} ''''Foobar'''' was also used as a variable name in the [[Fortran]]
        code of ''''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'''' (1977 Crowther and Woods version).
        The variable FOOBAR was used to contain the player''s progress in saying the
        magic phrase \"Fee Fie Foe Foo\".\n\nFoo''s use in code is indeed as a place
        holder for an as yet unnamed object. The fact that it is often followed by
        Bar as another placeholder is due to the popularity of the 1987 movie Lethal
        Weapon. In the movie the lead makes reference to FUBAR. Foo however is not
        the same as FU. Foo was originally from Foo Fighters and that a Foo is an
        unidentified object. Foo and Fubar have been conflated as the majority of
        people are unfamiliar with Foo Fighters.\n\n==Usage in code==\nThe terms are
        very often used in programming examples, much like the [[Hello World]] program
        is commonly used as an introduction.  For example, ''''foo'''' and ''''bar''''
        might be used to illustrate a simple string concatenation:\n\n<syntaxhighlight
        lang=\"c\">\n/* C code */\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main()\n{\n   char
        *foo = \"Hello\";\n   char *bar = \"World!\";\n   fprintf(stdout, \"%s %s\\n\",
        foo, bar);\n\n   return 0;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\nAlso see  [[metasyntactic
        variables#Programming language examples|metasyntactic variables]].\n\n==Usage
        in speech==\nThe terms are used in speech in an analogous way, although older
        synonyms may be used.  For example, \"''''Some function foo'''' will then
        be called\".  In these cases, ''''foo'''' and ''''bar'''' are synonyms for
        ''''whatever'''' or ''''whichever''''. Or: \"A database record for user ''''foo''''\"
        is synonymous with: \"A database record for user ''''whoever''''\".\n\n==Usage
        in culture==\n''''$foo'''' is the name of a [[Perl]] programming magazine,<ref>[http://foo-magazin.de/
        foo-magazin.de] {{de icon}}</ref> and [[Foo Camp]] is an annual [[hacker convention]].\n\nDuring
        the ''''[[United States v. Microsoft Corp.]]'''' trial, some evidence was
        presented that Microsoft had tried to use the [[Web Services Interoperability]]
        organization as a means to stifle competition, including e-mails in which
        top executives including [[Bill Gates]] referred to the WS-I using the codename
        \"foo\".<ref>[http://www.news.com/Microsoft-ploy-to-block-Sun-exposed/2100-1001_3-912906.html
        Microsoft ploy to block Sun exposed], news.com</ref>\n\nThese terms gave the
        name to [[foobar2000]], an audio player independently developed using C++,
        as its author was more focused on producing a functional program than on aesthetics.\n\nThere
        is a character named \"Master Foo\" in ''''Rootless Root'''', a collection
        of [[hacker koans]].\n\nGoogle releases https://google.com/foobar in November
        2014.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Computer programming}}\n* [[BarCamp]], an

        as a [[nonsense word]] from the 1930s, the military term [[FUBAR]] emerged
        in the 1940s, and the use of ''''foo'''' in a programming context is generally
        credited to the [[Tech Model Railroad Club]] (TMRC) of [[Massachusetts Institute
        of Technology|MIT]] from circa 1960.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3092.txt|title=Etymology
        of \"Foo\"}}</ref> However, the precise relationship of these terms is not
        known with certainty, and several anecdotal theories have been advanced to
        identify them.\n\nThe etymology of ''''foo'''' is explored in the [[Internet
        Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) RFC 3092, which gives the earliest documented
        use as being in the 1930s comic ''''[[Smokey Stover]]'''' by [[Bill Holman
        (cartoonist)|Bill Holman]], where it is used as a nonsense word.<ref name=\"jargon\">http://catb.org/jargon/html/F/foo.html
        foo</ref><ref>http://catb.org/jargon/html/index.html</ref> Holman states that
        he used the word due to having seen it on bottom of a jade Chinese figurine
        in [[Chinatown, San Francisco]], meaning \"good luck\".<ref>http://www.smokey-stover.com/history.html</ref><ref>[http://www.smokey-stover.com/
        smokey-stover.com]</ref><ref>http://members.aol.com/EOCostello/</ref> This
        is presumably as a transliteration of the [[fu character]] (f\u00fa, \u798f),
        which is a common character for fortune, and figurines of the trio of eponymous
        male \"star gods\" ''''[[Fu Lu Shou|F\u00fa, L\u00f9, Sh\u00f2u]]'''' are
        common in Chinese communities; compare [[Fu Manchu]], fictional character
        popular in the 1930s. ''''Smokey Stover'''' ran 1935\u201373, and continued
        to feature ''''foo'''' prominently, as on the front of the \"foomobile\" illustrated
        in the cover at right. The word ''''foo'''' became very popular in the 1930s,
        and also appeared in other cartoons including the ''''[[Looney Tunes]]''''
        cartoons of [[Bob Clampett]] such as ''''[[The Daffy Doc]]'''' and ''''[[Porky
        in Wackyland]]'''' (both 1938, with [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Porky Pig]]), and
        in other comic strips such as ''''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]''''.\n\nFrom there,
        the Foo migrated into military slang, merged with \"FU\" of the [[FUBAR]].<ref

        context appears in a 1965 edition of MIT''s \"Tech Engineering News\".<ref>{{cite

        indirect addressing thru location \"foo\", and location \"foo\" contained
        the address of location \"foobar\", than an effective word search for \"foobar\"
        would find location \"foo\" and the location containing the \"add\" instruction
        as well.}}</ref> ''''Foobar'''' may have come about as a result of the pre-existing
        \"Foo\" being conjoined with \"bar\" an addition borrowed from the military''s
        FUBAR. The use of ''''foo'''' in hacker and eventually in programming context
        may have begun in MIT''s [[Tech Model Railroad Club]] (TMRC). In the complex
        model system, there were [[scram]] switches located at numerous places around
        the room that could be thrown if something undesirable was about to occur,
        such as a train going full-bore at an obstruction. Another feature of the
        system was a digital clock on the dispatch board. When someone hit a scram
        switch the clock stopped and the display was replaced with the word \"FOO\";
        at TMRC the scram switches are therefore called \"Foo switches\". Because
        of this, an entry in the 1959 Dictionary of the TMRC Language went something
        like this: \"FOO: The first syllable of the misquoted sacred chant phrase
        ''[[Om mani padme hum|foo mane padme hum]].'' Our first obligation is to keep
        the foo counters turning.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computer-dictionary-online.org/?q=foo|title=Computer
        Dictionary Online}}, computer-dictionary-online.org</ref> One book{{which|date=November
        2010}} describing the MIT train room describes two buttons by the door: labelled
        foo and bar. These were general purpose buttons and were often re-purposed
        for whatever fun idea the MIT hackers had at the time, hence the adoption
        of foo and bar as general purpose variable names. An entry in the \"Abridged
        Dictionary of the TMRC Language\" states:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tmrc.mit.edu/dictionary.html|title=Abridged
        Dictionary of the TMRC Language|publisher=[[MIT]]}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text
        = Multiflush: stop-all-trains-button. Next best thing to the red door button.
        Also called FOO. Displays \"FOO\" on the clock when used.}}\n\nThe term ''''foobar''''
        was propagated through computer science circles in the 1960s and early 1970s
        by system manuals from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]].{{citation needed|date=May
        2009}} ''''Foobar'''' was also used as a variable name in the [[Fortran]]
        code of ''''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'''' (1977 Crowther and Woods version).
        The variable FOOBAR was used to contain the player''s progress in saying the
        magic phrase \"Fee Fie Foe Foo\".\n\nFoo''s use in code is indeed as a place
        holder for an as yet unnamed object. The fact that it is often followed by
        Bar as another placeholder is due to the popularity of the 1987 movie Lethal
        Weapon. In the movie the lead makes reference to FUBAR. Foo however is not
        the same as FU. Foo was originally from Foo Fighters and that a Foo is an
        unidentified object. Foo and Fubar have been conflated as the majority of
        people are unfamiliar with Foo Fighters.\n\n==Usage in code==\nThe terms are
        very often used in programming examples, much like the [[Hello World]] program
        is commonly used as an introduction.  For example, ''''foo'''' and ''''bar''''
        might be used to illustrate a simple string concatenation:\n\n<syntaxhighlight
        lang=\"c\">\n/* C code */\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main()\n{\n   char
        *foo = \"Hello\";\n   char *bar = \"World!\";\n   fprintf(stdout, \"%s %s\\n\",
        foo, bar);\n\n   return 0;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\nAlso see  [[metasyntactic
        variables#Programming language examples|metasyntactic variables]].\n\n==Usage
        in speech==\nThe terms are used in speech in an analogous way, although older
        synonyms may be used.  For example, \"''''Some function foo'''' will then
        be called\".  In these cases, ''''foo'''' and ''''bar'''' are synonyms for
        ''''whatever'''' or ''''whichever''''. Or: \"A database record for user ''''foo''''\"
        is synonymous with: \"A database record for user ''''whoever''''\".\n\n==Usage
        in culture==\n''''$foo'''' is the name of a [[Perl]] programming magazine,<ref>[http://foo-magazin.de/
        foo-magazin.de] {{de icon}}</ref> and [[Foo Camp]] is an annual [[hacker convention]].\n\nDuring
        the ''''[[United States v. Microsoft Corp.]]'''' trial, some evidence was
        presented that Microsoft had tried to use the [[Web Services Interoperability]]
        organization as a means to stifle competition, including e-mails in which
        top executives including [[Bill Gates]] referred to the WS-I using the codename
        \"foo\".<ref>[http://www.news.com/Microsoft-ploy-to-block-Sun-exposed/2100-1001_3-912906.html
        Microsoft ploy to block Sun exposed], news.com</ref>\n\nThese terms gave the
        name to [[foobar2000]], an audio player independently developed using C++,
        as its author was more focused on producing a functional program than on aesthetics.\n\nThere
        is a character named \"Master Foo\" in ''''Rootless Root'''', a collection
        of [[hacker koans]].\n\nGoogle releases https://google.com/foobar in November
