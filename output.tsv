'''Partners In Health''' ('''PIH''') is a [[Boston, Massachusetts]]-based non-profit [[health care]] organization founded in 1987 by [[Paul Farmer|Dr. Paul Farmer]], [[Ophelia Dahl]], Thomas J. White, Todd McCormack, and [[Jim Kim|Dr. Jim Yong Kim]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Kidder|first=Tracy|title=Mountains Beyond Mountains: The Quest of Dr. Paul Farmer, a Man Who Would Cure the World|year=2004|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-8129-7301-3|pages=317}}</ref>

The goals of the organization are "to bring the benefits of modern medical science to those most in need of them and to serve as an antidote to despair." <ref>http://www.pih.org/pages/our-mission</ref> PIH has innovated alternative methods to the conventional curative method of treatment for the sick and preventing diseases before they occur. This model believes that primary health care is essential because health is a right and therefore, it should be available to everyone.<ref>Farmer, Paul E., Bruce Nizeye, Sara Stulac, and Salmaan Keshavjee. 2006. Structural Violence and Clinical Medicine. PLoS Medicine, 1686-1691.</ref> PIH strives to bring good [[medicine|medical care]] to the poor by establishing long-term partnerships with local sister organizations.
